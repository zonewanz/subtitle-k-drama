00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:15.945
("Ask Us Anything" School on a
cool day in October)

2
00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:22.929
Wait, I hear strange noises.

3
00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.709
(What's that?)

4
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.773
- It's like in a scary movie!
- Some bizarre alien!

5
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.289
(The bizarre creature appears
with loud noises)

6
00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:36.210
It's still so vivid in my memory.

7
00:00:36.258 --> 00:00:37.773
- What is?
- I had a dream.

8
00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.218
We're wondering what the metallic
sound is.

9
00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:41.781
Were you caught in a trap?

10
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.760
(Caught)

11
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.796
- We heard the sound!
- I broke out of it.

12
00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.796
But this dream I had, it was so vivid.

13
00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.718
He was caught in a trap but
he broke out of it!

14
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.218
(Listen to me, guys!)

15
00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:58.640
I went somewhere in my dream,
and there were a lot of people there.

16
00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:00.789
And they were all clapping.

17
00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.843
I was standing still, but I was holding
a big trophy award.

18
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.539
It felt so real, what do you think
it means?

19
00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.156
- Winning the grand prize!
- Must be about getting an award.

20
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:12.414
The grand prize at the end of the year!

21
00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:16.468
Your dream reminds me of something
so funny on the Internet.

22
00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:19.359
Someone really posted this.

23
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.851
Seo Jang-hoon walked into my living room,

24
00:01:22.876 --> 00:01:24.632
laid out an electric blanket, and slept.

25
00:01:24.664 --> 00:01:26.882
That'd be intruding.

26
00:01:28.503 --> 00:01:29.960
Very much so.

27
00:01:29.977 --> 00:01:33.515
The person who wrote this then asked,
"Should I buy a lotto ticket?"

28
00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.773
The person's asking people to
interpret this dream.

29
00:01:35.844 --> 00:01:39.210
Jang-hoon must've gone there
to sell an electric blanket

30
00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:40.554
Here's a response.

31
00:01:40.594 --> 00:01:43.296
"It means that difficult matters become
resolved and

32
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.710
your business will flourish, and an
unexpected guess will visit you

33
00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:48.828
to tell you a good news."

34
00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:51.812
It's known to be a dream of good fortune
when someone famous comes in.

35
00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:54.445
- It's a good dream!
- I'm relieved then.

36
00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:58.765
So this person interpreted the dream
as a good one, but there are 2 people

37
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.835
who clicked, "I don't agree."

38
00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:04.156
They didn't agree?

39
00:02:04.188 --> 00:02:07.398
A person can dream about us and depending
on how we are, some may say

40
00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.539
it's a good dream or a bad ream.

41
00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.031
That's why we have to work hard
and be good to others.

42
00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:15.859
How about giving life-advices
to one another?

43
00:02:15.898 --> 00:02:17.437
(Out of nowhere?)

44
00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:18.500
Like a relay?

45
00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:20.024
Yes, one after another.

46
00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.835
For Jang-hoon...

47
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.921
I'm sure there are many advices to give.

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.968
I think you should be cautious
about women.

49
00:02:26.047 --> 00:02:28.421
(A strong one from the get-go)

50
00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.375
Be careful, and careful again!

51
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:32.976
Plan things well.

52
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:34.960
Jang-hoon's mad.

53
00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:36.695
I'll make sure to remember.

54
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.968
(Thanks a lot, buddy!)

55
00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:42.398
(Jang-hoon to Sang-min this time)

56
00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.828
For Sang-min, I'd advice about health
more than anything.

57
00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:48.960
He should take care of his health.

58
00:02:48.992 --> 00:02:51.648
He's been very busy lately, extremely
busy, and I'm worried

59
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.617
his body might not be able to handle it.

60
00:02:53.642 --> 00:02:56.071
I wish for Sang-min to be careful
about his health.

61
00:02:56.195 --> 00:03:00.031
I'd like to say the same for Soo-geun,
about being healthy.

62
00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:04.367
You can see it from time to time,
he's losing hair.

63
00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.195
(His going bald is out in the open now)

64
00:03:10.453 --> 00:03:14.906
He's in bad shape, he's going bald and
also has gout.

65
00:03:14.953 --> 00:03:18.320
He might lose all of his teeth soon.

66
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.653
That's because you beat him up!

67
00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:23.889
(It was actually a warning)

68
00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:26.117
No, his teeth have been shaky,

69
00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:27.734
they've gotten weak.

70
00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:29.304
It really worries me a lot.

71
00:03:29.328 --> 00:03:31.661
We don't have the right to be sick!

72
00:03:31.742 --> 00:03:32.851
I don't show it, see?

73
00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:35.015
We're overlapping with advices
about health.

74
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.553
I'd like to tell Yeong-cheol something
that was already mentioned.

75
00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:40.093
Don't rush into things, be wary of women.

76
00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.210
- How'd you know?
- You've been talking to someone?

77
00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.664
(Yeong-cheol's dating, finally?)

78
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.804
Send her back, Yeong-cheol.

79
00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.968
She said she won't leave, surprisingly.

80
00:03:51.984 --> 00:03:54.710
But the girl keeps going overseas
whenever she's got time.

81
00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.875
(We should congratulate him
if it's true!)

82
00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.921
(Got it)

83
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.843
(Someone knocks on the door at that moment)

84
00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:08.375
- Who is it?
- Not confident enough.

85
00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:12.750
(Cute!)

86
00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:14.796
- It's Super Mario!
- How cute!

87
00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.117
(Yoon Jung-soo, popular again these days
second time around)

88
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:19.125
Wow, it's Ha Yeon-soo!

89
00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:21.609
(A famous and lovely actress,
Ha Yeon-soo)

90
00:04:21.672 --> 00:04:24.601
Look at the difference between
the sizes of their faces!

91
00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.015
(No Photoshop)

92
00:04:27.938 --> 00:04:29.664
Are you gaining more weight on purpose?

93
00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.390
How can you be the one to say that
to me?

94
00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.726
(I've never seen anyone else
with face that big)

95
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:36.867
Step out a bit, next to the desk.

96
00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:38.382
- Why?
- Let's take a look.

97
00:04:38.422 --> 00:04:41.335
I'm hiding behind this because
I don't want to look fat!

98
00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:43.914
You should exercise.

99
00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:47.343
Soo-geun whispered something when
Jung-soo was about to walk in.

100
00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.312
I'm not trying to be funny, seriously.

101
00:04:49.343 --> 00:04:51.476
"What happened to his body?"

102
00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:54.921
"Wow... What happened to his body?"

103
00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.734
(And he repeats it)

104
00:04:57.592 --> 00:04:59.192
What about my body?

105
00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.226
(All take a look at his body shape)

106
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.943
Am I missing organs? Body parts?

107
00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:06.248
You look like a kid who took the wrong type
of herbal medicine.

108
00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:07.414
(What'd you say?)

109
00:05:07.422 --> 00:05:10.148
Someone did tell me that I look like
a German kid who's studying abroad.

110
00:05:10.203 --> 00:05:12.429
Why are you wearing a monk's clothing
for school uniform?

111
00:05:12.454 --> 00:05:13.812
(Huge pants on him)

112
00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:16.007
Soo-geun can finally look down at someone.

113
00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:17.195
(Feeling tall)

114
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:18.811
(A confident hello)

115
00:05:19.273 --> 00:05:22.117
There's a cartoon by Go U-yeong
long time ago,

116
00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:24.148
it was called, "Garujigi."

117
00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.882
You look like him.

118
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:27.953
You're shorter than Soo-geun?

119
00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:29.359
(Be quiet!)

120
00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:32.187
Let me introduce myself.

121
00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:36.617
I came from "I know how Jang-hoon
feels now" high school.

122
00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:38.031
My name is Yoon Jung-soo.

123
00:05:38.063 --> 00:05:39.836
How I feel?

124
00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.390
You've never been married.

125
00:05:41.422 --> 00:05:43.710
I had to say goodbye to someone,
and I understand now.

126
00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:44.710
(Oh, that!)

127
00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:47.210
It was an imaginary divorce for a TV show,

128
00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:48.718
but I was really sad.

129
00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:53.101
- He did have a pretended marriage.
- How can amateurs say such a thing?

130
00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:55.093
You're not qualified to talk about going
through a break-up.

131
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.507
That's not the true break-up!

132
00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:58.429
(Can't say anything in front of
a real divorcee)

133
00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.602
- What kind of a break-up was it?
- Documents were exchanged.

134
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.820
We had contracts signed too!

135
00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.421
Wait, weren't you married for longer
than Jang-hoon?

136
00:06:08.477 --> 00:06:10.343
We were married for 2 years!

137
00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.039
How about you?

138
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:17.070
I knew her as a fellow comedian for
13 years, then were "married" for 2!

139
00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:19.234
It's much longer than
what you went through.

140
00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.781
Your face turned red, you look like
my thumb when I stop blood circulation.

141
00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.559
(Having so much fun teasing him)

142
00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:30.078
(I hear that often)

143
00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:34.414
I'm done with mine, let's listen
to Yeon-soo's introduction.

144
00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.172
Yeon-soo is really pretty!

145
00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:37.570
Thanks, Hee-chul.

146
00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:39.157
I heard a lot about you from Yeri.

147
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.210
She looks just like Yeri from Red Velvet.

148
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.835
You do look alike!

149
00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:46.718
They both look like turtles.

150
00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:48.366
Let me talk first.

151
00:06:48.414 --> 00:06:50.281
What school did you come from?

152
00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:54.554
From "Older than you think" high school,
and I'm Ha Yeon-soo.

153
00:06:55.212 --> 00:06:57.000
(Nice to meet you!)

154
00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:58.765
She sounds so smart!

155
00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.656
You're older than we think?

156
00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:01.437
How old are you?

157
00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:02.320
I'm 28.

158
00:07:02.344 --> 00:07:03.593
28 years old?

159
00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.875
That's not old enough for us.

160
00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:07.521
But 28...

161
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.726
She looks about 28 though.

162
00:07:09.975 --> 00:07:11.445
(No way!)

163
00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:13.398
That hurt her pride.

164
00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:16.242
(Checking with Jung-soo about
how old she looks)

165
00:07:16.266 --> 00:07:19.476
You didn't know this, but your school
said they changed their name.

166
00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:21.289
To "You look exactly your age" high school.

167
00:07:21.314 --> 00:07:23.031
(I really didn't know)

168
00:07:23.102 --> 00:07:25.343
We don't really say nice things
around here.

169
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:27.109
(It's not so easy here)

170
00:07:27.336 --> 00:07:31.265
She put pink makeup on
to look younger.

171
00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:33.890
Yes, I did go a little overboard today.

172
00:07:33.968 --> 00:07:36.390
- You look like a doll.
- Or a cartoon character.

173
00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.703
What's the Russian doll that's stacked
inside of another?

174
00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:40.851
Matryoshka doll!

175
00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:44.820
Yeah! She looks like one. You open
the lid and there's another doll.

176
00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:46.459
Look at her skin.

177
00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:49.476
I heard Yeon-soo purposely picked Jung-soo
to come here together,

178
00:07:49.492 --> 00:07:51.093
to look better in comparison.

179
00:07:51.118 --> 00:07:53.726
- That's not true.
- No, we have a secret...

180
00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:56.093
I don't think that's a good idea,
don't touch me.

181
00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:57.571
You make me feel nervous.

182
00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:59.296
What a tough guy!

183
00:08:00.172 --> 00:08:01.820
You gotta reject them from time to time.

184
00:08:01.836 --> 00:08:04.312
He's the best-speaking thumb in the world.

185
00:08:04.492 --> 00:08:07.234
Jung-soo's been so active on TV
even up to very recently,

186
00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:09.140
"The blue-chip" of TV variety shows!

187
00:08:09.165 --> 00:08:11.257
I loved you in "Match Made in Heaven."

188
00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:12.914
That's right!

189
00:08:13.086 --> 00:08:14.686
Hey, Ho-dong!

190
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.343
Don't hang out with these
weird little guys.

191
00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:20.093
You shined the brightest when you worked
with me.

192
00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:24.023
"Exciting Saturday night on fire!"

193
00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:26.820
You should forget about that,
it's been years.

194
00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:28.250
You can't live in the past.

195
00:08:28.295 --> 00:08:29.796
I don't have any other famous phrases.

196
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:32.554
How long will you just talk about
how famous you were before?

197
00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.492
Do you know why he decided to come today?

198
00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:37.820
- Why?
- Isn't it to thank me?

199
00:08:37.844 --> 00:08:39.757
- Why?
- I saw it!

200
00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:44.070
Jung-soo said that he had a dream about me
when things were rough.

201
00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:46.570
And things got much better after
having that dream!

202
00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:51.179
I saw your interview, you paid off 85%
of all your debt and it's because of me!

203
00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:55.187
You should've said that when you paid
off all your debt, why'd you leave 15%?

204
00:08:55.211 --> 00:08:58.531
Oh, they're from people who said I can
pay them back later.

205
00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:00.593
- 15% of your total debt?
- Yeah, so they gave me more time.

206
00:09:00.602 --> 00:09:02.601
- Wow, you should be grateful.
- I definitely am.

207
00:09:03.266 --> 00:09:05.203
I'm sure Sang-min understands
really well.

208
00:09:05.391 --> 00:09:08.210
There are some very nice people out there.

209
00:09:08.289 --> 00:09:09.046
It's true.

210
00:09:09.063 --> 00:09:11.859
Is it really like the movies where people
come to your house

211
00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.273
and put red stickers, saying that you don't
own them anymore?

212
00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:15.882
Yeah, they came and did that.

213
00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:16.898
Sounds so scary.

214
00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:21.929
Someone kept knocking on my door
like this.

215
00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.507
I wasn't feeling well, so I didn't
open the door.

216
00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:27.664
But then I heard, "Let's just
break it open then."

217
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:30.179
Then I heard this sound...

218
00:09:30.242 --> 00:09:31.515
For real?

219
00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:34.601
I got scared and I finally
opened the door.

220
00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:36.209
"What are you doing?"

221
00:09:36.928 --> 00:09:39.490
And they looked like government
workers.

222
00:09:39.602 --> 00:09:41.554
- Dressed in suits?
- Yeah, in suits.

223
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.320
If I can elaborate...

224
00:09:43.492 --> 00:09:47.046
They have to have a couple of people
who live in that town as witnesses,

225
00:09:47.078 --> 00:09:51.835
that's when the government workers
can bring a locksmith and enter.

226
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:55.437
Oh, there's a little more
detail you missed.

227
00:09:55.492 --> 00:09:58.500
That's only if the government workers
are from the county office.

228
00:09:58.539 --> 00:10:00.359
No, it's also true for the people
the court send.

229
00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:01.765
Not if there's police present.

230
00:10:01.805 --> 00:10:03.367
Oh, is that right?

231
00:10:03.632 --> 00:10:06.585
I'm always learning something new
on this show!

232
00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:09.257
So anyway, I asked them what they
were doing.

233
00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:14.498
They said that there was a court order
and they had to put on these red stickers

234
00:10:14.523 --> 00:10:17.203
on things that I own.

235
00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.210
They put on about 100-something
red stickers.

236
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.859
So if they put a red sticker on your TV
for example, you can't watch it?

237
00:10:22.906 --> 00:10:27.414
You can watch it, but you can't
take it outside.

238
00:10:27.477 --> 00:10:31.929
But the problem was that they put
the sticker on the remote part,

239
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:33.890
the sensor to pick up the remote control
signal.

240
00:10:33.922 --> 00:10:36.078
So the remote control wouldn't work!

241
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:38.445
(It's useless now)

242
00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:42.632
But I felt like something scary was going
to happen if I peeled it.

243
00:10:42.672 --> 00:10:45.304
So I just folded it like this.

244
00:10:45.352 --> 00:10:48.156
I folded it so I can use the remote.

245
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.421
- You can't peel off the sticker?
- You can't.

246
00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:54.148
- It's against the law.
- You can peel it, but gotta keep it.

247
00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:54.648
Really?

248
00:10:54.673 --> 00:10:58.039
Yes, but if you lose it or throw it away,
you can be prosecuted.

249
00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:01.460
What are we, competing over
how much we know about debt?

250
00:11:01.728 --> 00:11:03.773
(I'm the biggest debtor around here!)

251
00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:09.117
Then the court orders me to leave the house
so they can put it up for auction.

252
00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:14.164
The day I left the house after receiving
that order was my birthday, actually.

253
00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:20.609
So I moved out on my birthday and after
I finished moving everything,

254
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.593
another comedian that I know said,
"You should at least do this,"

255
00:11:23.618 --> 00:11:25.421
and brought out a birthday cake.

256
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:29.539
I felt like I was gonna die.
Of course I cried.

257
00:11:29.617 --> 00:11:31.156
It was a sad moment.

258
00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.617
I'm a little choked up now
talking about it.

259
00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:36.218
Nothing like this happened to you,
Yeon-soo?

260
00:11:36.242 --> 00:11:38.078
You haven't gone bankrupt yet?

261
00:11:38.102 --> 00:11:39.093
Sorry about "yet."

262
00:11:39.102 --> 00:11:40.703
I'm helping my family get out of debt.

263
00:11:40.728 --> 00:11:42.390
- Oh really?
- Yes.

264
00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:44.523
So I hope it goes well today.

265
00:11:44.828 --> 00:11:48.171
I heard people call you "Kim Yeong-cheol
in the acting field."

266
00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:52.226
That doesn't make me feel so good.

267
00:11:52.642 --> 00:11:55.304
It'll be better to have someone
cuss you out than that.

268
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.273
Yeah, might as well.

269
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.109
Not that, but you published a book of
your photo collection?

270
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.546
- Yeah.
- I heard it became a best-seller!

271
00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:04.335
I'm also the author of a best-seller.

272
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.875
Wow, really?

273
00:12:05.914 --> 00:12:07.984
You mean you wrote a book, not that
it became a best-seller.

274
00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:10.890
It's because none of you guys read, but
the book I wrote about learning

275
00:12:10.914 --> 00:12:12.828
English is a best-seller!

276
00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:13.757
Really?

277
00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:17.867
So you'd go back and forth from Korea
and other countries to take photos?

278
00:12:17.922 --> 00:12:20.437
Yes, I've been to Russia recently.

279
00:12:20.695 --> 00:12:21.898
- To take photos?
- Yeah.

280
00:12:21.923 --> 00:12:25.820
What are your themes? Photographers
usually have themes in their photos, right?

281
00:12:25.844 --> 00:12:27.444
For me...

282
00:12:27.633 --> 00:12:32.218
I like subjects like you whom I can feel
the beauty of age and experience from.

283
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.109
I like taking photos of grandpas
and grandmas.

284
00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:37.578
I'm a grandpa?

285
00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:40.703
You have a face that says a lot
about your past.

286
00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:43.132
I love photos likes that.

287
00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:46.585
She's smiling yet the jabs keep coming!

288
00:12:47.024 --> 00:12:48.421
It's not like that!

289
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.960
There is beauty to be found in
wrinkles of older people's faces.

290
00:12:54.742 --> 00:12:57.296
It makes you think about life
and its struggles.

291
00:12:57.336 --> 00:12:58.570
It's art.

292
00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.351
I brought it, actually.

293
00:13:02.258 --> 00:13:04.281
- You brought something?
- Yes.

294
00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:06.889
I brought my camera.

295
00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:08.757
It's a Polaroid.

296
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.445
- The old kind.
- Polaroid!

297
00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.734
- Can I take a picture of you?
- I feel embarrassed now.

298
00:13:12.773 --> 00:13:15.078
I can't believe you want to take
a picture of my face!

299
00:13:15.297 --> 00:13:16.078
Here it goes!

300
00:13:16.119 --> 00:13:18.914
You're not taking a picture of me
actually, sitting behind Ho-dong, right?

301
00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.500
(Grabbing everyone's attention)

302
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.828
(I know I'm famous)

303
00:13:25.062 --> 00:13:27.109
(He knows nothing about this, just happy
to get his solo shot)

304
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.039
Leave it flipped over like this
and see it in 20 minutes.

305
00:13:30.438 --> 00:13:33.929
(A special gift of a photo
Yeon-soo prepared)

306
00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:36.554
(But I'm the main character here!)

307
00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:41.406
For both of you, your body proportions
are unrealistic.

308
00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:44.406
One's got a really small face
and the other...

309
00:13:44.438 --> 00:13:45.742
He's not quite 5' 6", right?

310
00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:49.835
Nowhere near! He's not even 5' 4"
just at a glance.

311
00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:52.960
Is he taller than you, Soo-geun?
You're taller?

312
00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:54.211
I told you I'm 5' 4".

313
00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:58.875
You know your height follows your name,
right? That's why you're shrunk. [pun]

314
00:13:59.487 --> 00:14:02.414
You're "Jung-soo," that's why people
can see the top of your head. [pun]

315
00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.906
(Neither back down in this dissing war)

316
00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.179
Wait a second.

317
00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:09.375
Can't you tell I'm taller than you just
from seeing me walking towards you?

318
00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:12.335
Come over here if you're so sure!

319
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:15.703
I'm sure I can beat you at least,
among all the people.

320
00:14:15.816 --> 00:14:17.289
It hurts my ego.

321
00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:20.023
What's your height listed as
in your profile?

322
00:14:20.063 --> 00:14:21.546
I'm 165 cm for real.

323
00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:22.828
I'm 164.7.

324
00:14:24.648 --> 00:14:26.492
But Soo-geun looks taller.

325
00:14:27.586 --> 00:14:29.117
(Let's measure them!)

326
00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:32.000
Let me stand next to you first.
(Yeon-soo is 160 cm)

327
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:35.421
Soo-geun's definitely taller!

328
00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:36.680
(Feeling unsure)

329
00:14:36.705 --> 00:14:38.984
We can do it with shoes off,
I got nothing in my shoes.

330
00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:41.209
I got nothing in my shoes either!

331
00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:43.828
(A war over height between
the 2 shortest people)

332
00:14:44.988 --> 00:14:45.734
Wait!

333
00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:48.648
(Putting on the brakes)

334
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:51.929
(His confidence level drops right before
the actual measuring)

335
00:14:51.954 --> 00:14:55.485
Don't stand next to each other yet,
but just walk past each other first.

336
00:14:56.133 --> 00:14:58.492
I look shorter with the backpack on,
can I take this off?

337
00:14:58.508 --> 00:15:00.108
I'll take it.

338
00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:02.851
(The moment of truth)

339
00:15:06.286 --> 00:15:07.703
(Tiptoe)

340
00:15:09.657 --> 00:15:11.570
(Come on, Jung-soo!)

341
00:15:11.616 --> 00:15:13.398
Jung-soo, just walk straight!

342
00:15:13.484 --> 00:15:15.421
You gotta change your
profile information then.

343
00:15:15.445 --> 00:15:17.632
I think you must be 167!

344
00:15:18.031 --> 00:15:19.679
(Likes the idea)

345
00:15:19.727 --> 00:15:22.164
- I haven't really measured.
- Maybe you're still growing!

346
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:23.811
Let's go for real.

347
00:15:25.245 --> 00:15:26.789
I always walk like this.

348
00:15:29.904 --> 00:15:32.765
Wait a minute, his hair is really poofy.

349
00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:34.406
(That's not the reason!)

350
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:37.648
Your hair's this tall by itself!

351
00:15:37.968 --> 00:15:39.632
Your hair's spiked up too!

352
00:15:39.858 --> 00:15:41.703
(Gets up quietly)

353
00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.460
Hey, let me see.

354
00:15:44.642 --> 00:15:46.585
What are you guys doing?

355
00:15:46.656 --> 00:15:48.389
(Gulliver in Lilliput.avi)

356
00:15:50.007 --> 00:15:51.078
See?

357
00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:53.820
Soo-geun's shoulder's higher too.

358
00:15:53.984 --> 00:15:57.906
Jung-soo! Then Jang-hoon's arms must be
longer than your legs, right?

359
00:15:58.414 --> 00:16:00.046
(Hm?)

360
00:16:00.977 --> 00:16:04.226
Jung-soo will be 2 inches taller if we
just loosen up his calves.

361
00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:06.679
(His height is all hidden here)

362
00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:09.148
His legs are shorter than my arms?

363
00:16:09.952 --> 00:16:11.171
We can measure.

364
00:16:11.258 --> 00:16:13.265
I'm holding a fist.

365
00:16:15.343 --> 00:16:16.867
(Same height here)

366
00:16:16.898 --> 00:16:18.109
Jang-hoon's arm's longer!

367
00:16:18.148 --> 00:16:19.765
(Neither can believe it)

368
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.929
Jung-soo, then it's like you have 4 arms?

369
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:28.312
It's like you're standing on your
hands right now.

370
00:16:29.148 --> 00:16:30.882
(This doesn't look strange at all)

371
00:16:30.914 --> 00:16:33.031
What am I, a desk?

372
00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:35.695
Study!

373
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.367
Bring us what your papers.

374
00:16:39.523 --> 00:16:42.468
- You do have a good body proportion.
- Thanks, Jung-soo.

375
00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:46.062
We have 3 people in the class today
who've been married and back?

376
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.132
Wait, 4.

377
00:16:48.163 --> 00:16:49.963
The ratio's about the same.

378
00:16:50.328 --> 00:16:52.156
Him, him, him, and him.

379
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:56.351
These 2 don't count, you can't put
amateurs in this mix.

380
00:16:56.789 --> 00:17:00.242
Why do you want to be "a professional"
this time?

381
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.046
(Strict requirements to join their league)

382
00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:06.784
I don't think it's right.

383
00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:09.570
Admission application,
name: Yoon Jung-soo.

384
00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.292
Nickname: Yoon Housewife.

385
00:17:11.422 --> 00:17:15.359
I like doing housekeeping work,
I've lived alone for a long time.

386
00:17:15.398 --> 00:17:16.984
He's really good at it.

387
00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:21.992
He's really clean, though he doesn't
look the part.

388
00:17:22.063 --> 00:17:23.953
Why do you say he doesn't look it?

389
00:17:24.481 --> 00:17:28.710
He seems like he just likes to eat
and not clean.

390
00:17:28.844 --> 00:17:30.375
But he's really clean.

391
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.710
It doesn't fit you that you're
so clean either.

392
00:17:35.186 --> 00:17:36.171
(Quickly apologizes)

393
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:37.795
I was surprised!

394
00:17:40.465 --> 00:17:42.531
(Jang-hoon learns something new
about himself today again)

395
00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:45.414
I am pretty clean, and I say so myself.

396
00:17:45.445 --> 00:17:49.460
I used to think that my house was
already clean, but I stood up on a chair

397
00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:50.953
and saw how dirty it was.

398
00:17:50.992 --> 00:17:53.765
There's dust everywhere above my head.

399
00:17:55.734 --> 00:17:57.334
I know what you mean.

400
00:17:57.477 --> 00:18:01.335
We can see Jung-soo's sincere heart
in this last determination he wrote.

401
00:18:01.445 --> 00:18:06.312
He said, "I'm gonna kick a few out
and sit in this classroom."

402
00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:09.062
- I don't really want Yeong-cheol's seat.
- Why not?

403
00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:11.671
Even if I sit there, I'll just end up
having everyone blame me.

404
00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:13.303
He's so wise!

405
00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:15.867
They don't even pay me sit here.

406
00:18:15.898 --> 00:18:18.804
- Really?
- Just kidding!

407
00:18:20.434 --> 00:18:24.414
But it seems like it's the easiest seat
for me to take.

408
00:18:24.507 --> 00:18:26.906
You'll be the first to get kicked out
for not being funny.

409
00:18:27.725 --> 00:18:31.218
Yeong-cheol, you should pay the network
to sit there and be in the show.

410
00:18:31.242 --> 00:18:32.671
(You think so?)

411
00:18:32.703 --> 00:18:35.218
You should be paying them
if you're gonna be that boring!

412
00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:36.562
It must be this seat!

413
00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:40.062
I heard there's a seat in this station
that you pay rent for!

414
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.742
Yes, it's like a school, you pay a monthly
fee to sit here and learn.

415
00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:49.703
That's a great idea! Charge celebrities
for their seats.

416
00:18:49.742 --> 00:18:51.789
They take deposits and sell seats
to them.

417
00:18:51.836 --> 00:18:54.812
And I can have someone sublet
this seat?

418
00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:57.242
Good idea! With a security deposit.

419
00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:59.468
Now it's Yeon-soo's turn.

420
00:19:00.141 --> 00:19:02.523
Yeon-soo's nickname is "Kobugi,"
like a turtle.

421
00:19:02.563 --> 00:19:03.882
It fits you.

422
00:19:03.914 --> 00:19:05.695
She does look like a turtle.

423
00:19:05.758 --> 00:19:07.539
She looks like Yeri, too.

424
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.312
Her flaw is that she looks a little
awkward, not clearly pretty.

425
00:19:10.336 --> 00:19:11.960
- Not at all!
- Really?

426
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.067
If her face is awkward, what about
our faces?

427
00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:16.828
"Our" faces?

428
00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:21.515
(I'm not your kind)

429
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.437
You think you're a little better-looking
in this crowd, right?

430
00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:29.203
I never thought I was actually bad-looking.

431
00:19:30.906 --> 00:19:32.506
Honestly speaking,

432
00:19:32.562 --> 00:19:34.625
these 2 are not like us, we all agree.

433
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.726
But what about you? Who do you
think you are?

434
00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:40.093
I'm not in your league for sure,
Jang-hoon and Ho-dong.

435
00:19:40.156 --> 00:19:43.085
Honestly, isn't Soo-geun a little more
like us instead?

436
00:19:43.377 --> 00:19:45.843
Let me take a look and see
who looks better.

437
00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.281
How about me sitting here?

438
00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:51.343
Your face isn't so bad, really.

439
00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:54.101
Your entire body makes you look
ugly though.

440
00:19:54.742 --> 00:19:57.023
You think you're any better?

441
00:19:58.326 --> 00:20:00.125
You look like a Boy Scout.

442
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.617
What's up with your pants?

443
00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:03.359
What about my pants?

444
00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:05.164
You look younger than before though.

445
00:20:05.189 --> 00:20:08.015
Your skin looks good. You look
the same from years ago.

446
00:20:09.718 --> 00:20:12.140
Short people don't get old that fast.

447
00:20:12.172 --> 00:20:13.835
It's an advantage we have.

448
00:20:13.883 --> 00:20:16.531
He's gotta have something at least
to survive.

449
00:20:18.443 --> 00:20:20.867
He does look really young.

450
00:20:21.894 --> 00:20:24.921
I felt like I was dying for a few years.

451
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:30.632
Yeon-soo's got a very unique strength.

452
00:20:30.734 --> 00:20:33.742
She draws, but using her toes.

453
00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:35.703
No way!

454
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.031
There are people who can use their feet
like their hands.

455
00:20:39.086 --> 00:20:44.617
Jin from BTS opened a plastic bag
with his toes last time, too.

456
00:20:44.844 --> 00:20:46.921
Show us your skill, Yeon-soo.

457
00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:51.640
(At ease)

458
00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:55.398
Draw one of us, and we'll guess
who it is.

459
00:20:55.913 --> 00:20:56.617
OK.

460
00:20:56.641 --> 00:21:01.726
My arms are short, maybe I can replace
my arms with her legs.

461
00:21:01.914 --> 00:21:03.648
Yeon-soo lives a tough life.

462
00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:07.409
- You're keeping your socks on?
- Hey, it seems legit.

463
00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.679
I can tell it's Yeong-cheol
just from that.

464
00:21:09.719 --> 00:21:11.429
You're right!

465
00:21:12.135 --> 00:21:13.765
(Long face with Beethoven hair)

466
00:21:14.012 --> 00:21:16.273
(Looking 100% same!)

467
00:21:16.565 --> 00:21:18.843
(She can draw quickly and stably,
as if she's drawing with her hand)

468
00:21:18.906 --> 00:21:21.007
She's picking out characters quickly,
like a "creature."

469
00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:22.686
"Creature"?

470
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.445
What are you, talking about an alien?

471
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.929
(Caricature...)

472
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:31.460
(Her drawing gets more and more complete
as crowd around her talks)

473
00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:36.390
It's me, right? It looks just like me.

474
00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:37.960
Looks a little cooler than you.

475
00:21:38.023 --> 00:21:40.356
Let me draw with my hand this time.

476
00:21:40.406 --> 00:21:41.648
OK, with your hand this time!

477
00:21:41.695 --> 00:21:44.585
Let's see how good she is with her hand.

478
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.789
(Focused)

479
00:21:47.543 --> 00:21:49.226
(Quickly)

480
00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:52.343
- Wow, she's really good!
- And she's fast!

481
00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.062
(She's already done with an outline)

482
00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:03.789
(They're amazed at how well she draws)

483
00:22:06.155 --> 00:22:08.242
(Done already!)

484
00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:11.039
(Looks just like him!)

485
00:22:11.303 --> 00:22:13.296
Looks like a Communist.

486
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:17.561
Or Swings, the rapper!

487
00:22:17.609 --> 00:22:19.257
Here, insert a...

488
00:22:20.098 --> 00:22:21.698
(Draw a star here!)

489
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:23.703
(She fixes her drawing
at their fervent request)

490
00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:26.539
He looks like a Chinese soldier who fought
at the Korean War!

491
00:22:26.577 --> 00:22:28.531
(And he looks just like Ho-dong)

492
00:22:28.609 --> 00:22:30.209
(Inserting a small star)

493
00:22:31.956 --> 00:22:33.179
She's good!

494
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.375
(With detailed finishing touches)

495
00:22:37.117 --> 00:22:39.234
She can draw like a cartoonist.

496
00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:41.359
(They look the same)

497
00:22:41.773 --> 00:22:43.625
Thanks!

498
00:22:46.266 --> 00:22:49.640
I'll give you a very personal quiz
about myself.

499
00:22:49.711 --> 00:22:51.171
We like personal questions.

500
00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:53.765
Jung-soo, try hard to get these too.

501
00:22:53.937 --> 00:22:54.828
OK.

502
00:22:54.844 --> 00:22:59.125
If you single me out like that,
I might misunderstand your intention.

503
00:23:01.048 --> 00:23:02.773
What's wrong with you?

504
00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:05.742
Isn't that true? She singled me out.

505
00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:11.132
It's a very personal question starting
with the first one.

506
00:23:11.163 --> 00:23:12.570
Hope you get it.

507
00:23:12.594 --> 00:23:14.394
I'll get all of them right.

508
00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:17.812
I was so upset after my first love
said he wanted to break up with me.

509
00:23:17.859 --> 00:23:21.523
So I gave him a condition, "If you do
these things then I agree to break up."

510
00:23:21.563 --> 00:23:24.171
What do you think I said?
I was 20.

511
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:25.421
8 years Ag.

512
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.625
Just keep dating me for one more month.

513
00:23:29.898 --> 00:23:35.039
If you still want to break up after
we date another month, then it's over.

514
00:23:35.078 --> 00:23:36.492
"See you after 4 weeks!"

515
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:41.851
"I'll kill you if you date someone
younger than me."

516
00:23:41.992 --> 00:23:43.421
(What was that?)

517
00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:48.007
How long did you guys go out for
before he broke up with you?

518
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.492
A month.

519
00:23:49.508 --> 00:23:50.609
Just a month?

520
00:23:50.656 --> 00:23:52.632
Yeon-soo must've done something wrong.

521
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.179
Were you caught stealing something?

522
00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:56.078
No, nothing like that!

523
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.265
If it's not something bad like that,
why after a month?

524
00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:01.148
(They're making up stories again)

525
00:24:01.188 --> 00:24:03.851
"I agree to breaking up if you don't
tell anyone that I stole."

526
00:24:03.882 --> 00:24:07.453
"Just give me another month, I'll return
everything I stole from you."

527
00:24:09.203 --> 00:24:11.593
"Throw up all the food we ate together."

528
00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:14.406
(She brings out the hammer
without saying anything)

529
00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:17.406
I hope you throw up after
getting hit by this.

530
00:24:21.148 --> 00:24:22.476
(Crash!)

531
00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:24.123
This is a new method!

532
00:24:24.812 --> 00:24:26.412
I did not expect that.

533
00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:28.994
I didn't think she'd hit me like that.

534
00:24:29.203 --> 00:24:32.109
Now you're doing slap-stick comedy?

535
00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:35.210
I just didn't expect it.

536
00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:38.820
I'm curious, did you guys end up
breaking up after doing that?

537
00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:40.505
We did.

538
00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:43.773
I agree to break up if you give me
200,000 dollars.

539
00:24:43.844 --> 00:24:46.195
(Quietly walking up again)

540
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:50.390
She hit my ear!

541
00:24:50.477 --> 00:24:52.109
That's why he broke up with you!

542
00:24:54.485 --> 00:24:56.367
Because he was scared of you.

543
00:24:56.422 --> 00:24:58.755
It's something he had to do for me.

544
00:24:59.008 --> 00:24:59.914
Guess.

545
00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:03.015
In a crowded public place, like a plaza...

546
00:25:03.047 --> 00:25:03.843
(Surprised)

547
00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:05.320
Must be close.

548
00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:11.843
You asked him to yell really loudly,
"Yeon-soo, I love you!"

549
00:25:11.922 --> 00:25:14.398
No, but it's true that it involved
a crowded place.

550
00:25:14.492 --> 00:25:15.539
A famous dating spot.

551
00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.781
At a park...

552
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.187
It was in Seoul.

553
00:25:19.406 --> 00:25:22.625
"Buy me a pork cutlet in Namsan!"

554
00:25:22.992 --> 00:25:25.070
The location is correct.

555
00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:27.218
You know those steps in Namsan?

556
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:30.468
"If we play rock-paper-scissors and you
climb up the steps faster, I agree."

557
00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:33.109
A similar feel, but completely different
condition.

558
00:25:33.133 --> 00:25:35.710
You had a lock of love in Namsan
while you were dating.

559
00:25:35.727 --> 00:25:36.539
No, we didn't.

560
00:25:36.586 --> 00:25:38.046
"If you find it and open it,
we'll break up."

561
00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.678
No, no lock.

562
00:25:39.953 --> 00:25:41.523
Jang-hoon was the closest so far.

563
00:25:41.594 --> 00:25:44.195
Yeah, I'm always the closest one
before getting it wrong.

564
00:25:44.297 --> 00:25:46.429
Not a game, he had to do something.

565
00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:50.037
"I'll let you break up with me if you carry
me all the way up the steps in Namsan."

566
00:25:50.063 --> 00:25:51.546
Correct!

567
00:25:52.102 --> 00:25:55.062
(Seo Jang-hoon gets it right!)

568
00:25:57.241 --> 00:26:00.039
It is amazing that he got it right,
but why'd you do that?

569
00:26:00.055 --> 00:26:01.679
Don't you have any pride?

570
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.350
I didn't then.

571
00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:05.140
Get up!

572
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:06.772
And applaud!

573
00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:08.507
(Praise him!)

574
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.242
He got the answer, but did the boyfriend
really do that?

575
00:26:13.266 --> 00:26:14.460
Or did he quit?

576
00:26:14.492 --> 00:26:16.195
I'm sure he didn't actually do it.

577
00:26:16.234 --> 00:26:18.257
He did carry me up all the way to the top.

578
00:26:18.282 --> 00:26:21.453
He must've really wanted to
break up with you!

579
00:26:21.555 --> 00:26:26.132
You must've cried so hard when he
reached the top with you on his back.

580
00:26:26.164 --> 00:26:28.718
I started crying as soon as I got
on his back.

581
00:26:28.765 --> 00:26:30.960
(Heartbroken)

582
00:26:33.193 --> 00:26:34.984
I'm sure his back was soaked.

583
00:26:35.792 --> 00:26:37.687
No, let's not act it out.

584
00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:42.250
He was so mean too, he knew
that you were crying so hard.

585
00:26:42.305 --> 00:26:44.382
You should've tripped him.

586
00:26:44.422 --> 00:26:45.742
And make him fall.

587
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.117
Both will fall then.

588
00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.046
True.

589
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.484
You should've just told him to get lost
and kick him when

590
00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:51.695
he was about to carry you.

591
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.125
He was my first love!

592
00:26:53.164 --> 00:26:55.179
Those steps must have felt so short
for you.

593
00:26:55.195 --> 00:26:56.500
Yes, that's true.

594
00:26:56.546 --> 00:26:59.945
The one who's more in love is always
like a sinner.

595
00:26:59.961 --> 00:27:01.437
What a nice phrase!

596
00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:03.390
I loved many people before.

597
00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:06.101
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Why not?

598
00:27:06.156 --> 00:27:08.460
I don't know, I just think so.

599
00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.820
It's a life sentence for me if a lover
is a sinner.

600
00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:13.281
(Punishment for loving someone)

601
00:27:13.328 --> 00:27:17.906
So we got to the top, and now we had to
go back down, while I was still crying.

602
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.843
And we walked down those steps together,
as I was bawling.

603
00:27:21.898 --> 00:27:26.109
I was crying so hard, and he said something
to me on our way down.

604
00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:30.882
"I'll take you back if you still like me
the same after a few years."

605
00:27:31.437 --> 00:27:34.070
- Ridiculous!
- It's like a dog barking.

606
00:27:34.843 --> 00:27:36.858
"That makes no sense, you bastard!"

607
00:27:37.234 --> 00:27:40.468
You're getting completely different types
of responses than other places, right?

608
00:27:40.828 --> 00:27:42.210
I'm taken aback.

609
00:27:42.242 --> 00:27:43.842
We're like her dad.

610
00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:48.156
We're being completely honest,
it's a totally ridiculous thing to say.

611
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.351
It's just crap, what he said.

612
00:27:50.898 --> 00:27:52.773
Then I called him.

613
00:27:52.798 --> 00:27:54.437
No!

614
00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:56.031
Because you still liked him?

615
00:27:56.055 --> 00:27:58.007
I continued to like him.

616
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.702
- We met up, but...
- You were a bit clingy, don't you think?

617
00:28:03.141 --> 00:28:04.741
We did meet up.

618
00:28:05.273 --> 00:28:08.546
We met once, then another, then another.

619
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:11.234
And we dated each other again.

620
00:28:12.773 --> 00:28:14.000
And we dated each other again.

621
00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:15.578
(No way!)

622
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.960
- Then you broke up again?
- Yeah.

623
00:28:16.985 --> 00:28:19.015
See how meaningless it was?

624
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.890
What did you like so much about him?

625
00:28:20.945 --> 00:28:23.710
He was so opposite from me,
and I was attracted to that.

626
00:28:23.805 --> 00:28:25.405
Opposite in what way?

627
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:27.210
Our personalities.

628
00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.000
Our preferences.

629
00:28:28.023 --> 00:28:31.823
Did you ask him to carry you up a
ski resort this time?

630
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.906
No, we just agreed to break up.

631
00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:38.664
He's an expert on agreeing to break up.

632
00:28:40.337 --> 00:28:42.054
Bring in the camera!

633
00:28:44.736 --> 00:28:47.773
(Our expert on agreeing to break up)

634
00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:49.675
It went smoothly this time.

635
00:28:49.867 --> 00:28:51.757
Who broke up with whom this time?

636
00:28:51.812 --> 00:28:53.412
I did.

637
00:28:53.718 --> 00:28:54.929
Why?

638
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.898
It seemed like he didn't love me anymore.

639
00:28:57.977 --> 00:28:59.562
What made you come to that decision?

640
00:28:59.578 --> 00:29:02.757
His facial expressions, how he talked to
me, his actions...

641
00:29:02.828 --> 00:29:05.531
Why'd you ask him to carry you up
to Namsan?

642
00:29:05.594 --> 00:29:07.960
I've actually never been to Namsan.

643
00:29:07.992 --> 00:29:10.093
I thought it was this huge mountain.

644
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:12.375
I thought it'll take like 3 hours to go
back and forth.

645
00:29:12.406 --> 00:29:14.578
Oh, you thought it'd be impossible
for him to do that.

646
00:29:14.609 --> 00:29:15.812
Where did you grow up that you've
never been to Namsan?

647
00:29:15.828 --> 00:29:17.625
Busan.

648
00:29:18.453 --> 00:29:20.328
You have no accent at all!

649
00:29:20.445 --> 00:29:21.414
I can!

650
00:29:21.461 --> 00:29:22.367
Show us.

651
00:29:22.422 --> 00:29:23.671
I am right now.

652
00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:25.695
(She's still got it!)

653
00:29:27.148 --> 00:29:30.281
- You're from Haeundae?
- Yes, how'd you know?

654
00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.420
I just guessed.

655
00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:34.578
(She thought he knew something)

656
00:29:35.102 --> 00:29:38.843
He only knows Haeundae and Gwangalli
in Busan.

657
00:29:40.047 --> 00:29:42.875
(He finds it amazing too)

658
00:29:43.227 --> 00:29:44.382
Haeundae is a big region.

659
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.109
Give us the next question.

660
00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:47.578
OK, just wait.

661
00:29:47.617 --> 00:29:49.250
Her accent's so cute!

662
00:29:49.304 --> 00:29:52.414
How long did you live there? From your
voice, it must've been at least until

663
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.429
you were a senior in high school.

664
00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.703
You're totally right!

665
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.585
Completely accurate.

666
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.007
- You came to Seoul when you were 20?
- You're right!

667
00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:01.937
Then you met that boyfriend as soon
as you came to Seoul?

668
00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:03.414
Pretty much, yeah.

669
00:30:03.438 --> 00:30:05.585
You liked his soft Seoul accent?

670
00:30:05.656 --> 00:30:07.256
Yeah!

671
00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:09.554
"Yeon-soo, did you eat yet?"

672
00:30:09.602 --> 00:30:11.585
(Impressed by his Seoul accent)

673
00:30:11.844 --> 00:30:13.444
(Getting crazy)

674
00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:14.390
(Now stern)

675
00:30:16.816 --> 00:30:18.429
Was he better looking than me?

676
00:30:18.469 --> 00:30:19.281
Yes!

677
00:30:20.367 --> 00:30:21.703
(Not feeling good)

678
00:30:21.828 --> 00:30:23.273
Why would you ask that?

679
00:30:23.313 --> 00:30:24.070
Of course he was.

680
00:30:24.102 --> 00:30:25.601
More charming than me?

681
00:30:25.656 --> 00:30:27.398
His skin tone was similar to yours.

682
00:30:28.008 --> 00:30:30.773
There's gotta be nothing similar that she
had to compare skin tones.

683
00:30:32.473 --> 00:30:34.710
At least the eyes or the nose!

684
00:30:34.727 --> 00:30:37.796
Where can you ever find someone
who's like Ho-dong?

685
00:30:37.836 --> 00:30:39.578
(The one and only!)

686
00:30:40.742 --> 00:30:43.500
Now this is about my next boyfriend.

687
00:30:43.525 --> 00:30:45.015
The next one.

688
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.414
So after this boyfriend and I broke up,

689
00:30:48.492 --> 00:30:51.375
I even did this to try to
win his heart again.

690
00:30:52.164 --> 00:30:54.234
You put a mole on your face
with a marker.

691
00:30:54.511 --> 00:30:56.171
To pretend to be a different person.

692
00:30:56.942 --> 00:30:59.156
(Wrong answer)

693
00:30:59.391 --> 00:31:01.687
It'll have to be a really big mole.

694
00:31:02.031 --> 00:31:06.468
You figured out where he goes
in his daily life.

695
00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:08.343
You kept making yourself to run into him
in his route.

696
00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:09.835
Making it seem like coincidence.

697
00:31:09.859 --> 00:31:11.609
It's a little similar.

698
00:31:12.313 --> 00:31:13.726
Like you ran into him on coincidence?

699
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:15.852
That's the worst! No one should do that.

700
00:31:15.883 --> 00:31:17.335
You drank and...

701
00:31:17.383 --> 00:31:19.945
No one should do that, it's the worst
of being clingy.

702
00:31:19.984 --> 00:31:21.648
- You drank...
- I really don't think...

703
00:31:21.695 --> 00:31:24.117
OK, stop it, Jang-hoon!

704
00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:25.804
You're the worst of the clingy type!

705
00:31:25.829 --> 00:31:26.953
Let him talk for once!

706
00:31:26.984 --> 00:31:29.390
Sorry, but it's just so bad.

707
00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:31.609
What's so terrible about it?

708
00:31:31.687 --> 00:31:34.835
I think it's just so terrible to plant
yourself to "run into him"

709
00:31:34.852 --> 00:31:38.320
by figuring out where he'd go next.

710
00:31:38.422 --> 00:31:40.820
I really hate that idea, no one should
do that.

711
00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:43.281
What you're saying is right, but
think about how desperate she was.

712
00:31:43.328 --> 00:31:46.851
I understand the desperation,
but it doesn't help, so don't.

713
00:31:48.497 --> 00:31:50.289
Was he always this much of an expert
in dating?

714
00:31:50.327 --> 00:31:52.273
I'm a little surprised myself.

715
00:31:52.837 --> 00:31:56.828
Nothing like that, but it's just
the worst thing to do.

716
00:31:57.156 --> 00:32:00.382
No. Let me elaborate.

717
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.625
(Kyung-hoon loses his chance again)

718
00:32:02.664 --> 00:32:04.703
I called him and told him,
then I went there.

719
00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:07.945
You drank everyday and went to
go see him everyday.

720
00:32:07.977 --> 00:32:08.382
No.

721
00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:09.695
She can't drink.

722
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.313
No, I drink about 2 and a half bottles
of soju.

723
00:32:11.548 --> 00:32:12.906
(Jaw-dropping)

724
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.023
But that's not what's important!

725
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.413
It's very important to us!

726
00:32:19.068 --> 00:32:20.937
This was the funniest moment today.

727
00:32:20.983 --> 00:32:22.843
"No, 2 and a half bottles of soju for me."

728
00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:26.001
You can see that she didn't have
a typical life in the past.

729
00:32:26.094 --> 00:32:28.359
You put yourself in a delivery box.

730
00:32:28.453 --> 00:32:30.421
You went to him with a turtle mask.

731
00:32:30.484 --> 00:32:32.084
Similar.

732
00:32:32.312 --> 00:32:35.523
You put on the life-size body suit
you see in amusement parks.

733
00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.178
Very similar.

734
00:32:37.547 --> 00:32:42.359
You pretended to deliver flowers
then opened your helmet.

735
00:32:43.148 --> 00:32:45.117
The doll mask is right.

736
00:32:45.258 --> 00:32:46.851
It was a cat mask.

737
00:32:47.461 --> 00:32:49.906
I regretted telling him that we should
break up.

738
00:32:49.938 --> 00:32:52.070
And I did this to take it back.

739
00:32:52.141 --> 00:32:54.054
So it was a gesture to make up.

740
00:32:54.102 --> 00:32:56.906
So you put on a Hahoe mask [pun]
and pretended to be a famous comedian.

741
00:33:00.885 --> 00:33:02.554
(Of course not!)

742
00:33:03.008 --> 00:33:05.000
She has to know how to act like him then.

743
00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:09.765
You were waiting for him at his bus stop
or a subway stop,

744
00:33:09.797 --> 00:33:12.679
and you stood next to him wearing
the big mask.

745
00:33:13.443 --> 00:33:15.921
That's so cute, I should've done that.

746
00:33:15.969 --> 00:33:17.569
How's that cute?

747
00:33:18.742 --> 00:33:21.164
You waited for him in front of his house
with the mask on!

748
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:23.570
(Yeong-cheol gets it right!)

749
00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:28.960
I put on this whole body suit of a cat,
but couldn't fit in a taxi.

750
00:33:29.008 --> 00:33:31.929
- The head was too big.
- The taxi driver let you?

751
00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:33.640
Yeah, he did.

752
00:33:33.648 --> 00:33:37.421
The taxi driver helped me take out
the head piece, so I got in.

753
00:33:37.477 --> 00:33:40.789
Now I had to get off and he helped me
put back the head piece again.

754
00:33:40.843 --> 00:33:47.351
And I had to pay, but because of the huge
glove, I couldn't pull out my card.

755
00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.085
Her life's like a sitcom.

756
00:33:49.219 --> 00:33:52.781
Anyhow, I put back the costume, and
there was a kindergarten in front of

757
00:33:52.806 --> 00:33:54.187
his house.

758
00:33:54.212 --> 00:33:57.242
So all these kids were pointing
at me, wanting to play.

759
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:59.960
It's like going to a bee house
covered in honey.

760
00:33:59.977 --> 00:34:02.578
- Then?
- Then I waited for him with flowers.

761
00:34:02.648 --> 00:34:03.882
What'd he say?

762
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:06.661
He sighed, like a sigh of relief.

763
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.945
Your mind told you to put on
a body suit of a cat?

764
00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:10.789
Yes.

765
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.882
(Signal received)

766
00:34:11.922 --> 00:34:14.609
Why'd you break up again after
working to hard to get back together?

767
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.513
Difference in personality.

768
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:21.000
(Looks at him again)

769
00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:23.000
Stop looking at me!

770
00:34:24.414 --> 00:34:25.937
Everyone's got a different personality.

771
00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.453
That's true.

772
00:34:27.477 --> 00:34:30.077
Just like there's difference in height.

773
00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:34.382
What do you guys do if someone wants
to break up with you but you don't?

774
00:34:34.453 --> 00:34:38.078
You can't hold on to a person's heart
once the person already leaves.

775
00:34:38.164 --> 00:34:40.195
You guys never asked to reconsider?

776
00:34:40.273 --> 00:34:42.703
Yeong-cheol never dated
to begin with.

777
00:34:42.728 --> 00:34:45.429
(Official dating record is unknown)

778
00:34:45.727 --> 00:34:47.250
(He feels like he won somehow)

779
00:34:47.273 --> 00:34:48.109
Is that true though?

780
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:50.140
He said he's never kissed before.

781
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:51.718
Really?

782
00:34:51.743 --> 00:34:53.109
(He's now given up)

783
00:34:53.148 --> 00:34:54.859
He was going to kiss, but he got slapped.

784
00:34:54.883 --> 00:34:55.710
She hit me.

785
00:34:55.742 --> 00:34:56.781
(How sad...)

786
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:02.203
It was with a foreigner?

787
00:35:08.124 --> 00:35:11.906
Anyway, I hope you find your true love.

788
00:35:11.984 --> 00:35:13.953
Maybe one of you might date me.

789
00:35:13.992 --> 00:35:14.929
- That's true.
- Yes.

790
00:35:14.954 --> 00:35:17.187
- I have a chance too?
- Yes, of course!

791
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.015
- I have a chance too?
- Yes, of course!

792
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.218
- Really?
- Yes.

793
00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:22.179
I know, I'm so popular.

794
00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:24.398
It's OK if someone's a lot older?

795
00:35:24.748 --> 00:35:26.156
(Is it OK if I don't answer?)

796
00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:29.304
He was just saying not to get clingy!

797
00:35:29.523 --> 00:35:31.734
I don't think Yeon-soo cares that much
about age difference.

798
00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:32.648
He's right.

799
00:35:32.688 --> 00:35:34.742
What's the acceptable range
of age difference?

800
00:35:34.758 --> 00:35:36.882
Well, can't be a minor.

801
00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:38.937
How about older?

802
00:35:38.953 --> 00:35:41.718
As long as someone doesn't feel
like my dad.

803
00:35:41.796 --> 00:35:43.476
What kind of a personality do you like?

804
00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:45.960
Someone responsible.

805
00:35:46.445 --> 00:35:48.609
Someone who's kind and gentle.

806
00:35:48.758 --> 00:35:51.492
And someone who takes care of
his own business.

807
00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:53.139
That's totally me then.

808
00:35:53.305 --> 00:35:55.453
Nothing about the looks?

809
00:35:55.477 --> 00:35:56.648
How about the out-appearances?

810
00:35:56.695 --> 00:36:00.437
Just someone... With the same vibe
when he's with me.

811
00:36:00.508 --> 00:36:03.195
What kind of a vibe is that?

812
00:36:03.313 --> 00:36:05.820
She's saying, "Someone not ugly."

813
00:36:05.845 --> 00:36:07.796
Why go around in circles?

814
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:13.734
How can I do that? How can I not be ugly?

815
00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:17.492
She's saying, "I hope he's decent-looking."

816
00:36:17.523 --> 00:36:19.648
Someone I can kiss.

817
00:36:20.854 --> 00:36:25.132
Tell us your limit among us
for you to kiss.

818
00:36:25.157 --> 00:36:26.578
It's too cruel.

819
00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:29.398
How many people here you think
you just can't kiss?

820
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.453
How many?

821
00:36:31.194 --> 00:36:33.820
Let's say everyone's the same age.

822
00:36:34.729 --> 00:36:36.218
(OK, got it)

823
00:36:36.257 --> 00:36:38.203
And no one's married.

824
00:36:38.837 --> 00:36:40.531
Don't move, don't move!

825
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.562
Don't mention any names.

826
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:45.273
Just how many?

827
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.703
I think I can kiss maybe 6 from here.

828
00:36:48.742 --> 00:36:50.343
(He's counting how many total)

829
00:36:50.406 --> 00:36:53.984
(Who are the 2 that are just impossible
for her to kiss?)

830
00:36:55.265 --> 00:36:57.617
I would've been sad if it was just one.

831
00:36:57.663 --> 00:36:59.156
I feel like I'm on the line.

832
00:37:00.805 --> 00:37:02.726
I really want to know which two.

833
00:37:02.773 --> 00:37:04.484
One on each side?

834
00:37:04.586 --> 00:37:05.843
Yes.

835
00:37:06.198 --> 00:37:08.429
(One in each side!)

836
00:37:10.598 --> 00:37:13.164
Let's reveal it for our side.

837
00:37:13.382 --> 00:37:14.820
(All agree?)

838
00:37:14.938 --> 00:37:17.820
I don't want to!

839
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.562
No, I won't say it!

840
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:24.757
I think it has to be Ho-dong then.

841
00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:27.968
(Unsure what to do)

842
00:37:28.062 --> 00:37:29.476
She said she likes Ho-dong.

843
00:37:29.477 --> 00:37:31.664
What color of clothing?
Milk or chocolate?

844
00:37:32.297 --> 00:37:34.578
What color of clothing?
Milk or chocolate?

845
00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:37.389
How about initials for color? M? C?

846
00:37:37.429 --> 00:37:39.710
Sometimes it's better not to know.

847
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:41.609
- Let's not find out.
- I agree.

848
00:37:41.648 --> 00:37:42.882
It doesn't feel resolved.

849
00:37:42.922 --> 00:37:44.664
I feel the same.

850
00:37:45.749 --> 00:37:47.976
Can I go on to my next problem?

851
00:37:48.039 --> 00:37:50.257
I think you're the problem.

852
00:37:52.015 --> 00:37:54.117
Yes! Jung-soo, you're absolutely right.

853
00:37:54.164 --> 00:37:55.601
This time, I was the problem.

854
00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:57.292
- Really?
- Yeah, I was.

855
00:37:58.063 --> 00:37:59.382
Hope you get it right.

856
00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:01.760
(She's definitely unique)

857
00:38:03.336 --> 00:38:04.703
When I was little...

858
00:38:04.733 --> 00:38:09.882
Someone stopped me and said that
there was a bad vibe or energy around me.

859
00:38:09.922 --> 00:38:12.929
So I followed him, and I said something.

860
00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:15.437
What do you think I said?

861
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.054
"Carry me there!"

862
00:38:19.765 --> 00:38:21.687
"Can I live here?"

863
00:38:23.148 --> 00:38:25.531
"Do you provide food and lodging?"

864
00:38:26.468 --> 00:38:28.289
(Wrong answer, Jang-hoon)

865
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:30.030
"What a liar!"

866
00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:34.226
"You all want to be arrested
by the police?"

867
00:38:34.375 --> 00:38:35.975
It's very close.

868
00:38:36.156 --> 00:38:39.281
"I'm gonna call the cops if you don't
let me go right away!"

869
00:38:39.688 --> 00:38:41.288
That's right.

870
00:38:42.391 --> 00:38:43.953
Jang-hoon got so good at this.

871
00:38:44.008 --> 00:38:45.789
I feel embarrassed that I get it
right all the time now.

872
00:38:45.844 --> 00:38:47.765
I thought of it, but thought it was
too obvious.

873
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.609
Sorry that I keep getting
all the right answers.

874
00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:52.531
Then you shouldn't have.

875
00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:54.390
If you knew you were right.

876
00:38:54.437 --> 00:38:56.765
You went there but you wanted
to call the cops?

877
00:38:56.813 --> 00:38:59.140
They said it was a meditation facility.

878
00:38:59.172 --> 00:39:03.632
I wanted to see what they would tell me,
like they'd prescribe something for me.

879
00:39:03.672 --> 00:39:07.007
But they just told me to get into
an empty room.

880
00:39:07.055 --> 00:39:11.070
Then they told me to pray standing up
for 50 minutes.

881
00:39:11.242 --> 00:39:13.484
I was so appalled.

882
00:39:13.509 --> 00:39:16.210
I told them I'm gonna call the cops
on all of them.

883
00:39:16.258 --> 00:39:18.406
"What is this place?"

884
00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:19.820
Did you call the cops?

885
00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:24.015
I did dial, but they try to take away
my phone and stopped me.

886
00:39:24.422 --> 00:39:27.820
- Then they let you go right then?
- Yes, right away.

887
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.929
You were much stronger than
they thought, I'm sure.

888
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.812
I was a little scared, to be honest.

889
00:39:32.852 --> 00:39:35.617
I had to walk down on my own,
I was scared they might chase me.

890
00:39:35.648 --> 00:39:37.515
But not when you were going in?

891
00:39:38.797 --> 00:39:43.023
I was confident that nothing bad
would happen to me.

892
00:39:43.148 --> 00:39:46.671
And the person who approached me was
a girl, so I was curious.

893
00:39:46.766 --> 00:39:50.812
- She was younger than me.
- Someone younger than you took you there?

894
00:39:50.945 --> 00:39:54.773
On top of that, she had pink shoes,
pink jacket, and pink scarf.

895
00:39:54.844 --> 00:39:56.718
Hey, that's me!

896
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.773
Let me try to remember.

897
00:39:57.805 --> 00:39:58.929
I was 20.

898
00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:01.570
Hey it's gotta be around the same time...

899
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:02.687
You should be careful.

900
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.726
- It can get dangerous.
- Don't follow strangers.

901
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:06.781
Many things happened to you
when you were 20.

902
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.195
She must've been very curious about
Seoul.

903
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.960
Yes, I was very curious.

904
00:40:11.063 --> 00:40:12.195
It's that age.

905
00:40:12.265 --> 00:40:16.532
What do you guys do when you're
really curious about something?

906
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:18.351
I don't get so curious.

907
00:40:18.492 --> 00:40:21.203
Aren't you curious about buildings
and real estate?

908
00:40:21.242 --> 00:40:23.070
Not really, actually.

909
00:40:23.095 --> 00:40:25.421
He's already got all that he wants,
and he's done it all.

910
00:40:25.452 --> 00:40:28.139
More than what I have or done...

911
00:40:28.734 --> 00:40:32.671
I just stay still, I don't really have
anything I'm curious about.

912
00:40:32.727 --> 00:40:34.414
How about you, Jung-soo?

913
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.054
I have no interest in things outside
of my field.

914
00:40:37.195 --> 00:40:39.195
- We're the same way.
- Most people are like that.

915
00:40:39.258 --> 00:40:42.351
I'm interested in things like, "Hey,
there are 4 women drinking,

916
00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.006
wanna join them?"

917
00:40:44.562 --> 00:40:46.882
- He does have an interest in dating.
- Yes.

918
00:40:46.938 --> 00:40:48.906
It's not wrong for me to have an interest
in women.

919
00:40:48.953 --> 00:40:50.343
Of course not.

920
00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:52.734
If I can reveal the person in this line,

921
00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:54.938
it's Jung-soo whom I won't kiss.

922
00:40:58.898 --> 00:41:00.734
What are you doing?

923
00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:03.640
(Runs away)

924
00:41:03.749 --> 00:41:05.124
(The giant saw something)

925
00:41:05.148 --> 00:41:08.742
I saw Ho-dong's face as soon
as she said that.

926
00:41:08.914 --> 00:41:10.664
He's got a huge smile on his face!

927
00:41:12.302 --> 00:41:14.435
It's Jung-soo whom I won't kiss.

928
00:41:14.749 --> 00:41:16.349
(First relieved)

929
00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:20.320
(Then a huge smile across his face)

930
00:41:21.855 --> 00:41:23.593
(And embarrassed after)

931
00:41:24.036 --> 00:41:25.062
(He's still burning with anger)

932
00:41:25.117 --> 00:41:26.914
Did I ever ask you to date me?

933
00:41:27.229 --> 00:41:29.265
(She keeps running away)

934
00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:32.156
Did I ever ask you to go out with me?

935
00:41:32.218 --> 00:41:34.281
(Sorry, sorry!)

936
00:41:34.762 --> 00:41:36.851
(Makes me mad to think about it)

937
00:41:36.883 --> 00:41:38.750
How about this side! Who is it?

938
00:41:38.789 --> 00:41:39.804
What about this side?

939
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:41.742
Reveal it for this side too!

940
00:41:41.805 --> 00:41:43.531
Don't do it!

941
00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:44.835
(There seems to be an understanding)

942
00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.171
It's not necessary, don't do it.

943
00:41:46.227 --> 00:41:47.468
Is it him at the end?

944
00:41:48.548 --> 00:41:50.609
Yeah, that's right.

945
00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:52.460
She didn't say anything.

946
00:41:52.836 --> 00:41:54.585
Look at her response!

947
00:41:55.338 --> 00:41:57.101
(Trying to stay calm)

948
00:41:57.544 --> 00:41:58.679
She's cute.

949
00:41:58.719 --> 00:42:01.117
I don't want to hear her questions
anymore.

950
00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:03.617
I'm not curious about her at all.

951
00:42:04.332 --> 00:42:05.968
(Take courage, my friend)

952
00:42:06.328 --> 00:42:07.546
(Whatever)

953
00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:09.343
(Yeon-soo's quiz time really
brought the house down)

954
00:42:11.086 --> 00:42:12.492
Now it's time for my quiz.

955
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:14.382
The last question already?

956
00:42:14.928 --> 00:42:16.528
We had such a good time.

957
00:42:16.607 --> 00:42:18.207
That was great!

958
00:42:21.258 --> 00:42:23.304
(We're done shooting today?)

959
00:42:25.906 --> 00:42:27.506
He takes our joke.

960
00:42:28.516 --> 00:42:31.312
Most of my questions are about women.

961
00:42:32.734 --> 00:42:35.203
It's about things he doesn't have,
like an illusion.

962
00:42:35.227 --> 00:42:38.718
I was in a car with a woman, about
6 years ago.

963
00:42:38.828 --> 00:42:41.101
But my stomach started hurting
really badly.

964
00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:43.695
I was holding it but...

965
00:42:44.148 --> 00:42:46.835
And I let one out, naturally.

966
00:42:47.062 --> 00:42:48.662
- You farted?
- Yes.

967
00:42:48.734 --> 00:42:50.906
But the smell was so bad.

968
00:42:50.914 --> 00:42:54.750
I was taken aback, and opened the
window just a tiny bit.

969
00:42:54.804 --> 00:42:56.984
That's how the smell can get sucked out.

970
00:42:57.063 --> 00:42:59.828
But she said something to me then.

971
00:42:59.945 --> 00:43:01.554
"It's gotta be poop!"

972
00:43:04.345 --> 00:43:06.867
(I won't let you slide)

973
00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:11.429
"Jung-soo! Did you eat poop?"

974
00:43:13.122 --> 00:43:15.428
It's a hammer party.

975
00:43:15.578 --> 00:43:18.429
"Jung-soo, don't open the window
it smells like trash."

976
00:43:18.937 --> 00:43:20.737
"Are you a piece of trash?"

977
00:43:20.875 --> 00:43:22.703
I've heard that often, but...

978
00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:25.664
"Someone must have a pig here."

979
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:28.413
"But you're that pig! You pooped
like a pig!"

980
00:43:29.172 --> 00:43:30.972
(I'll make you poop blood!)

981
00:43:31.599 --> 00:43:33.101
Put out your hands.

982
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:34.732
(No mercy)

983
00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:37.234
I'll act out the gesture she made.

984
00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:40.898
That's gotta be it.

985
00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:45.820
"There must be something around here,
how can a human being..."

986
00:43:45.906 --> 00:43:47.867
Form it into a sentence!

987
00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.226
"There must be a pigsty around here!"

988
00:43:50.845 --> 00:43:54.328
(Ho-dong gets it right!)

989
00:43:56.586 --> 00:43:59.601
It's gotta be someone who's
not that young.

990
00:43:59.641 --> 00:44:01.398
Yes, that's true.

991
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:04.250
Not many people would say, "pigsty."

992
00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:06.218
Was she older than you?

993
00:44:07.786 --> 00:44:10.046
She was about 37 or 38 then.

994
00:44:10.094 --> 00:44:12.627
See? Young people don't say
"pigsty."

995
00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:15.781
"There must be a pigsty around here,
close the window."

996
00:44:15.805 --> 00:44:18.576
You think she really didn't know?
Or she pretended so you won't be

997
00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:19.382
embarrassed?

998
00:44:19.414 --> 00:44:21.014
She had no idea.

999
00:44:21.313 --> 00:44:23.632
Then you guys broke up?

1000
00:44:23.836 --> 00:44:26.531
They don't usually pick up my calls
after we hang out.

1001
00:44:29.992 --> 00:44:33.328
That's a clever way to do it,
what she said.

1002
00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:35.945
So I did that a few times.

1003
00:44:36.094 --> 00:44:39.062
I kept blaming on pigsties that must
be around.

1004
00:44:39.087 --> 00:44:40.468
I'd use that as an excuse.

1005
00:44:40.484 --> 00:44:42.226
She should've said something more.

1006
00:44:42.336 --> 00:44:46.382
"There must be a pigsty around here.
Have you had your fodder today?"

1007
00:44:48.015 --> 00:44:50.734
She was a bit dull with those things.

1008
00:44:51.195 --> 00:44:52.718
She didn't even hear it?

1009
00:44:52.758 --> 00:44:54.398
Not if it's like this.

1010
00:44:54.484 --> 00:44:56.335
The silent ones are the deadliest.

1011
00:44:56.375 --> 00:45:01.007
The silent ones smell the worst.

1012
00:45:01.094 --> 00:45:02.500
(They're the fart experts)

1013
00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:04.570
I think it's because I had a few drinks.

1014
00:45:04.617 --> 00:45:07.132
Soo-geun lets one out while we shoot.

1015
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:10.610
Sometimes my fart gives me a boost,
like a rocket.

1016
00:45:13.531 --> 00:45:15.131
How about you, Yeon-soo?

1017
00:45:15.242 --> 00:45:16.304
Me?

1018
00:45:16.328 --> 00:45:18.148
What if you need to far while
you're on a date?

1019
00:45:18.188 --> 00:45:20.078
Her body type farts loudly.

1020
00:45:21.633 --> 00:45:22.445
A loud boom!

1021
00:45:22.461 --> 00:45:23.718
You can't just hit the person?

1022
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.203
Why hit the person? It was a big one?

1023
00:45:26.539 --> 00:45:28.812
We were OK with each other
farting before.

1024
00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.164
- With your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1025
00:45:30.281 --> 00:45:31.523
(Is this a true story?)

1026
00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:32.882
When you were 20?

1027
00:45:32.906 --> 00:45:35.046
He did first.

1028
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:37.992
It's good for women to do that.

1029
00:45:38.133 --> 00:45:43.078
Holding your fart in can cause a huge
problem to your stomach later.

1030
00:45:43.164 --> 00:45:44.398
- With too much gas.
- Yeah.

1031
00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:48.570
It's the funniest tool for
a momentary laughter.

1032
00:45:49.093 --> 00:45:52.875
So I purposely hold it in until
I'm in an enclosed space.

1033
00:45:53.188 --> 00:45:55.007
It's a talent too.

1034
00:45:55.047 --> 00:45:57.580
- It is.
- It's hard to fart at will.

1035
00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:59.742
I feel too embarrassed.

1036
00:45:59.859 --> 00:46:02.085
You look like you can.

1037
00:46:04.592 --> 00:46:07.179
You don't look so clean either.

1038
00:46:08.144 --> 00:46:09.593
(I knew that already)

1039
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:11.929
It's funny that he accepts it.

1040
00:46:12.156 --> 00:46:13.756
The second question!

1041
00:46:14.516 --> 00:46:18.500
I was in a pretend-marriage
with Kim Sook for a TV show.

1042
00:46:18.765 --> 00:46:26.031
And there was a moment I thought
she was a really cool woman.

1043
00:46:26.507 --> 00:46:27.437
When do you think it was?

1044
00:46:27.462 --> 00:46:29.546
When you saw how rich she was.

1045
00:46:30.398 --> 00:46:35.546
When she washed your feet while you were
on a trip to Japan.

1046
00:46:36.914 --> 00:46:40.023
I have very dry feet, I hate it
when people touch my feet.

1047
00:46:40.094 --> 00:46:43.406
You guys kissed, and you felt something
in your heart.

1048
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.195
Am I right? I'm right, aren't I?

1049
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.812
- They kissed? - Why don't you admit
to the truth while you're here?

1050
00:46:49.837 --> 00:46:53.712
- Turn around. - You could tell
us, it's okay. - Turn around!

1051
00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.790
You'll fart when I hit you,
if you're a real comedian.

1052
00:46:56.907 --> 00:47:01.598
The worst scene in this world is when a
small person hits another small person.

1053
00:47:01.728 --> 00:47:04.657
- Wrong! - It wasn't a recording
but an unofficial encounter.

1054
00:47:04.931 --> 00:47:08.148
- Yes, it wasn't a recording.
- Either a lot of people were around...

1055
00:47:08.173 --> 00:47:11.649
or you guys had dinner and she
secretly give you her card...

1056
00:47:11.813 --> 00:47:15.180
and says, "Jung-soo, you
should pay with my card".

1057
00:47:15.431 --> 00:47:19.977
Or, she pays for the whole meal and
tells everyone Jung-soo paid for it.

1058
00:47:20.681 --> 00:47:24.330
He makes you feel manly, but you
guys weren't even on the program.

1059
00:47:24.579 --> 00:47:26.657
At a dinner meeting. You'd be moved.

1060
00:47:26.782 --> 00:47:29.502
Why? Don't you have any money, Jung-soo?

1061
00:47:29.892 --> 00:47:32.352
he's paying back his debt these days.

1062
00:47:32.618 --> 00:47:35.305
There was a time when my
money wasn't my money.

1063
00:47:35.368 --> 00:47:37.351
Don't sign someone else's guarantee.

1064
00:47:37.376 --> 00:47:41.688
You were moved when she introduced
you to friends as her husband.

1065
00:47:41.915 --> 00:47:44.977
- That would be so burdensome.
- Really? - Of course.

1066
00:47:45.243 --> 00:47:49.516
I'll give you a hint. It was when I was
having a hard time. I was really down.

1067
00:47:49.665 --> 00:47:51.273
It was the hardest moment in  my life.

1068
00:47:51.298 --> 00:47:52.298
I think I know.

1069
00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:54.524
- I've got it.
- I think I know too.

1070
00:47:54.923 --> 00:47:58.923
- I know your mom passed away and...
- Yes, she passed away.

1071
00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:04.430
Kim Sook was at the funeral and stayed
at the funeral as if she was your wife.

1072
00:48:04.555 --> 00:48:05.555
You got it!

1073
00:48:06.837 --> 00:48:09.648
She stood by your side
through the whole thing.

1074
00:48:09.673 --> 00:48:12.626
She played the role of your
mom's daughter-in-law.

1075
00:48:12.712 --> 00:48:16.829
- She was there like the chief
mourner, wasn't she? - Yes, she did.

1076
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:21.641
She greeted people by half jokingly
telling people that she was my wife.

1077
00:48:21.666 --> 00:48:25.696
No one thought it to be strange since
we were a fake couple back then.

1078
00:48:25.798 --> 00:48:29.774
I was thankful when I saw her
doing that for me. I was moved.

1079
00:48:30.118 --> 00:48:32.960
- She's amazing. - Sook showed
a lot of loyalty. - Of course.

1080
00:48:32.986 --> 00:48:35.281
You never seriously thought about it?

1081
00:48:35.306 --> 00:48:38.040
Everyone told us we looked good together.

1082
00:48:38.697 --> 00:48:42.185
I thought she was great, but we
never saw each other in that way.

1083
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.823
We've been colleagues for over ten-years.

1084
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.704
How could I suddenly accept
her as something else?

1085
00:48:48.118 --> 00:48:51.579
Our appearances were too big
of a hill to climb for us.

1086
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.804
- Sook likes good-looking guys too.
- Of course, she does.

1087
00:48:55.829 --> 00:49:00.680
- It's important for her. - It could be
like when Yeon-soo didn't want to kiss him.

1088
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.400
(Shaking)

1089
00:49:02.641 --> 00:49:06.118
I think I should hit you for this one.
This is all your fault.

1090
00:49:06.228 --> 00:49:07.930
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1091
00:49:08.314 --> 00:49:09.314
Did you fart?

1092
00:49:11.275 --> 00:49:12.711
- Did you ask, if I farted?
- Yeah.

1093
00:49:12.736 --> 00:49:15.969
- I didn't hear anything.
- It just smells around you.

1094
00:49:18.712 --> 00:49:20.930
It smells like fart around you.

1095
00:49:21.978 --> 00:49:24.712
We were being serious and
you brought up farting.

1096
00:49:24.806 --> 00:49:26.337
That's all you could think of?

1097
00:49:26.517 --> 00:49:28.696
- I could smell it.
- You could?

1098
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:30.368
Now, the next question.

1099
00:49:31.314 --> 00:49:33.399
Just like Yeon-soo...

1100
00:49:33.424 --> 00:49:36.181
I've also had trouble
with the opposite sex.

1101
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:41.196
In 2003, I tried making a move on a
woman and heard something shocking.

1102
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:45.082
- It was 14-years ago?
- This was when I was actually popular.

1103
00:49:45.107 --> 00:49:47.039
- Something shocking?
- Match made in heaven.

1104
00:49:47.064 --> 00:49:49.632
I got it. "Please stand when
you're talking seriously".

1105
00:49:49.657 --> 00:49:50.657
Nope.

1106
00:49:52.853 --> 00:49:55.384
- You should stand up.
- I can identify with it.

1107
00:49:55.478 --> 00:49:57.570
- I said it because I know.
- You're the likeliest to get it right.

1108
00:49:57.595 --> 00:49:58.632
You see?

1109
00:49:58.657 --> 00:50:01.343
- What did you say to her?
- She told you, she had two kids.

1110
00:50:01.368 --> 00:50:02.368
Really?

1111
00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:06.423
Wait a second. I keep getting drawn in.
You're wrong.

1112
00:50:06.681 --> 00:50:08.765
I've lived a hard life. Why
are you doing this to me?

1113
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:10.101
How dare you?

1114
00:50:10.126 --> 00:50:13.048
It had a very similar tone to it.

1115
00:50:13.072 --> 00:50:14.782
A guy like you?

1116
00:50:15.134 --> 00:50:18.915
It was an answer to when I asked,
"Can I keep calling you?".

1117
00:50:19.087 --> 00:50:21.696
- I'm changing phones soon.
- Nope.

1118
00:50:22.048 --> 00:50:24.844
I'll show you how she
reacted without words.

1119
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:28.400
I got it.

1120
00:50:28.626 --> 00:50:30.313
- Geez, why?
- Nope.

1121
00:50:30.556 --> 00:50:32.188
- I got it!
- It's similar.

1122
00:50:32.454 --> 00:50:35.759
- You still don't get it?
- You're really close, but no.

1123
00:50:35.939 --> 00:50:39.282
- It's not the first time we talked on
the phone. - Say it, like you did.

1124
00:50:39.383 --> 00:50:41.293
Say it, so I can get into the role.

1125
00:50:41.348 --> 00:50:43.968
Do you think it'll be okay
for me to keep calling?

1126
00:50:43.993 --> 00:50:45.825
Stop while you're ahead.

1127
00:50:46.634 --> 00:50:50.141
It's already been hard enough
taking your phone calls.

1128
00:50:51.197 --> 00:50:54.657
- I got it. Why do you keep nagging me?
- It's kind of similar.

1129
00:50:54.962 --> 00:50:56.571
Why are you so obsessed?

1130
00:50:56.611 --> 00:51:00.274
- I told you, but why can't you...
- Understand what I'm saying!

1131
00:51:00.587 --> 00:51:02.907
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

1132
00:51:03.025 --> 00:51:06.118
Why don't you understand what I'm saying?

1133
00:51:06.259 --> 00:51:07.259
You got it!

1134
00:51:07.712 --> 00:51:11.532
- Should I be this happy about this?
- Look at how he likes it.

1135
00:51:11.907 --> 00:51:15.125
Aren't we right when we asked, why
you don't understand anything?

1136
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:20.446
Can I keep calling you? She said, "Why
don't you understand what I'm saying?".

1137
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.281
She packed a punch with that one line.

1138
00:51:22.306 --> 00:51:24.180
Ouch, that's hurtful.

1139
00:51:25.103 --> 00:51:27.212
How long did you meet her?

1140
00:51:27.275 --> 00:51:30.329
We dated about two or three times.
It was after that.

1141
00:51:30.384 --> 00:51:34.219
- She was mean.
- I don't think she knew how to reject me.

1142
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:36.898
Are you usually a bit obtuse at
understanding what people say?

1143
00:51:36.923 --> 00:51:39.625
Yes, I think so. It's kind of
hard for me to understand.

1144
00:51:39.743 --> 00:51:41.640
You're only focused on your emotions.

1145
00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:47.035
You like her, so it's not important the
way the other person feels about him.

1146
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.293
He's like a dating professor.

1147
00:51:48.318 --> 00:51:50.679
I think I could've been like
that when I was younger.

1148
00:51:50.704 --> 00:51:51.882
It's would be hard for the other person.

1149
00:51:51.907 --> 00:51:55.079
He's a dating professor for
everyone else, but himself.

1150
00:51:56.564 --> 00:51:59.466
- That was 2003, let's move onto 2005.
- Again?

1151
00:51:59.806 --> 00:52:02.989
Another woman told me
something shocking as well.

1152
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.485
A shocking statement in 2005.

1153
00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:08.084
Do you see what's going on?

1154
00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:11.548
In 2003, he tried coming onto
a woman and got blown away.

1155
00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:16.891
He rested a year and regained
his confidence in 2005.

1156
00:52:16.993 --> 00:52:18.852
That's why he tried again.

1157
00:52:18.986 --> 00:52:20.477
I got it, I have the answer.

1158
00:52:20.751 --> 00:52:21.751
- I got it.
- I got it.

1159
00:52:21.993 --> 00:52:23.739
Clean your ears out!

1160
00:52:24.197 --> 00:52:25.493
- Clean your ears?
- What's that?

1161
00:52:25.707 --> 00:52:28.211
It was during the early stages of dating.

1162
00:52:28.236 --> 00:52:30.687
The previous person, I
went on at least 3 dates.

1163
00:52:30.712 --> 00:52:33.358
Would it be okay, if I
treated you special?

1164
00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:36.001
- I got it!
- No, wait a second. I got it.

1165
00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:38.695
- Entertainers shouldn't act like that.
- Nope!

1166
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.571
I got it. Say your line to me.

1167
00:52:40.736 --> 00:52:44.811
- Would it be okay, if I treated you
special? - You're making me uncomfortable.

1168
00:52:44.836 --> 00:52:45.836
You got it!

1169
00:52:46.025 --> 00:52:47.782
(Hee-chul quickly gets it right)

1170
00:52:47.946 --> 00:52:48.946
What was it?

1171
00:52:49.064 --> 00:52:52.591
She said, "What the heck? You're
making me feel uncomfortable".

1172
00:52:52.712 --> 00:52:54.000
You made her uncomfortable.

1173
00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:58.493
- That was short and sweet. - How could
you make a move when you hear that?

1174
00:52:58.595 --> 00:53:00.071
You can't get upset either.

1175
00:53:00.134 --> 00:53:04.266
I said, "It seems like we're a
good match after talking to you.

1176
00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:07.321
Do you mind if I treated you special?".

1177
00:53:07.525 --> 00:53:10.470
She said, "What the heck? You're
making me feel uncomfortable".

1178
00:53:10.649 --> 00:53:13.930
She didn't even hesitate. She
didn't wait a second to say that.

1179
00:53:14.298 --> 00:53:18.310
You need to stay with the woman, who
sent you the congratulatory message.

1180
00:53:18.993 --> 00:53:23.114
You got totally rejected in 2003
when you tried making a move.

1181
00:53:23.204 --> 00:53:27.136
You made someone feel uncomfortable in
2005. You didn't make a move in 2004?

1182
00:53:27.161 --> 00:53:29.478
I'm about to ask you my question for 2004.

1183
00:53:29.618 --> 00:53:32.189
(He never stops trying to make a move)

1184
00:53:32.493 --> 00:53:36.899
I moved this question toward the end
since 2004's answer is a sentence.

1185
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.563
We were wondering why 2004 was missing.

1186
00:53:39.642 --> 00:53:43.099
There's no reason for me to stop.
There's no stopping me!

1187
00:53:43.282 --> 00:53:46.180
- You didn't date them, you were
just making a move. - Of course!

1188
00:53:46.454 --> 00:53:51.180
- He's already been rejected. - The way
I see it, he makes his move too fast.

1189
00:53:51.267 --> 00:53:52.696
- That's true.
- He's not patient.

1190
00:53:52.845 --> 00:53:58.790
He doesn't give the woman any time for
them to think about what's going on.

1191
00:53:59.016 --> 00:54:01.696
He just makes his move
whether she's ready or not.

1192
00:54:01.986 --> 00:54:04.462
Isn't it better for a guy
to profess his feelings...

1193
00:54:04.626 --> 00:54:06.649
before the third date is up?

1194
00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:09.993
My friends use a new word these days.
It's three-after.

1195
00:54:10.228 --> 00:54:11.282
Three-after?

1196
00:54:11.431 --> 00:54:15.396
If there aren't any feelings after three
dates, then it's not worth going forward.

1197
00:54:15.584 --> 00:54:16.882
That's how I feel too.

1198
00:54:16.907 --> 00:54:20.040
- It's over after three dates, if you
don't feel anything? - Yes, that's right.

1199
00:54:20.087 --> 00:54:24.774
That's only possible when both parties
are attracted to one another.

1200
00:54:25.337 --> 00:54:28.528
Jung-soo made a move when the women
didn't feel anything for him.

1201
00:54:28.576 --> 00:54:30.554
I'm sure that's not true. Don't say that.

1202
00:54:30.579 --> 00:54:32.025
No, that's possible.

1203
00:54:32.201 --> 00:54:36.212
When you're making moves on the opposite
sex and you want to make her...

1204
00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:38.907
your woman, it's best to wait a bit.

1205
00:54:39.454 --> 00:54:42.040
He's such a well-informed
dating professor.

1206
00:54:42.336 --> 00:54:45.101
He's such a well-informed dating professor.

1207
00:54:47.275 --> 00:54:48.812
A very well-informed professor.

1208
00:54:48.837 --> 00:54:51.656
Not a regular professor, but
a well-informed professor.

1209
00:54:51.681 --> 00:54:55.134
I haven't heard well-informed
professor in a long time.

1210
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:59.391
I can't think of anything to say
back to him because it's so funny.

1211
00:54:59.407 --> 00:55:03.188
Jang-hoon is theoretically the perfect guy.

1212
00:55:03.345 --> 00:55:05.366
I'm not theoretically
perfect but think about it.

1213
00:55:05.391 --> 00:55:11.274
Do you think I just laid around and
didn't do anything except for my ex-wife?

1214
00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:14.591
Do you think I didn't date
before getting married?

1215
00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.000
- Did you date in secret?
- Is that how you took it?

1216
00:55:17.025 --> 00:55:20.673
- You dated after you got divorced.
- Not after, before I got married.

1217
00:55:20.727 --> 00:55:23.794
- Before.
- Before and after? - Before.

1218
00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:24.990
Before.

1219
00:55:25.015 --> 00:55:29.283
It might have hurt then, but
it's important to be exact.

1220
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:31.492
It's best to let the other
person know how you feel.

1221
00:55:31.517 --> 00:55:33.920
It might be better for me
to hear someone be blunt...

1222
00:55:33.945 --> 00:55:37.369
because if they're nice, I might
misunderstand that again.

1223
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.188
- That's so sad.
- Why did she date you, in the first place?

1224
00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:44.095
Wasn't that the best answer she could give?

1225
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:46.923
It wasn't too bad for her to say
she felt uncomfortable, was it?

1226
00:55:47.033 --> 00:55:49.032
Her "What the heck" was really high.

1227
00:55:49.189 --> 00:55:52.313
"What the heck? You're making
me feel uncomfortable".

1228
00:55:53.439 --> 00:55:56.376
It would've been fine, if she
said it the way you did.

1229
00:55:56.673 --> 00:55:58.383
She shouted, "What the heck?".

1230
00:55:58.408 --> 00:56:02.047
- She tried playing it off.
- She thought he was totally senseless.

1231
00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:04.024
- Let's go with 2004.
- Okay, 2004.

1232
00:56:04.298 --> 00:56:06.392
The answer is pretty long.

1233
00:56:07.001 --> 00:56:08.357
A long sentence.

1234
00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:09.992
- I...
- You professed your feelings again.

1235
00:56:10.017 --> 00:56:13.517
I went so far to say this sentence.
What do you think I said?

1236
00:56:13.962 --> 00:56:16.259
Do you really hate me that much?

1237
00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:19.251
No, but it's kinds of...

1238
00:56:19.408 --> 00:56:23.560
- Do you think you're that great?
- No, then I couldn't date her anymore.

1239
00:56:24.501 --> 00:56:26.048
Think before you talk.

1240
00:56:26.189 --> 00:56:30.164
- She wouldn't date me anymore.
- We're not allowed to say those things.

1241
00:56:30.189 --> 00:56:33.195
- I like you so much. Don't you see
the way I feel about you? - No.

1242
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.325
- Don't you see my muscles?
- No.

1243
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.884
You can use me all you
want, just don't leave me.

1244
00:56:40.126 --> 00:56:41.126
Nope.

1245
00:56:41.525 --> 00:56:44.306
- Can't I just stay by your side?
- No.

1246
00:56:44.532 --> 00:56:46.566
You can treat me like your credit card.

1247
00:56:46.591 --> 00:56:48.372
Nope. I'll tell you what I said.

1248
00:56:48.572 --> 00:56:51.177
Do you treat your
boyfriend like this too?

1249
00:56:51.946 --> 00:56:54.282
That's what I said, "Do you treat
your boyfriend like this too?".

1250
00:56:54.307 --> 00:56:57.469
- You just said the answer. - No, that's
what I said because she was so mean.

1251
00:56:57.494 --> 00:57:00.829
- What did she say back to me?
- We're guessing her reply?

1252
00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.638
You're not my boyfriend.

1253
00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:06.110
"No, I don't treat my boyfriend like this".

1254
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.477
- You got it.
- Yes, that's right.

1255
00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:11.864
- He's a well-informed professor.
- Well-informed!

1256
00:57:12.501 --> 00:57:13.993
- Well-informed.
- Well-informed.

1257
00:57:14.244 --> 00:57:16.677
I'm hurt when I think about
what happened but...

1258
00:57:16.702 --> 00:57:21.220
the instant I heard it, I realized
I shouldn't make a move anymore.

1259
00:57:21.626 --> 00:57:23.470
Because those are hurtful words.

1260
00:57:24.025 --> 00:57:26.226
She cut you off even
before you tried anything.

1261
00:57:26.251 --> 00:57:28.845
I think Jung-soo is fast to make
a move, but fast to give up.

1262
00:57:28.947 --> 00:57:32.759
That's because he wasn't
crazy in love with her.

1263
00:57:33.486 --> 00:57:36.735
- You'd still go after her if you loved
her. - I'm realistic about love.

1264
00:57:36.939 --> 00:57:41.563
I'm not the type to keep forcing a woman
to like me if she's not interested.

1265
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:45.911
It's not right for me to keep liking
someone when they don't feel the same...

1266
00:57:46.032 --> 00:57:48.498
and someone else to like me.
It's all the same.

1267
00:57:48.523 --> 00:57:49.953
Someone liked you?

1268
00:57:49.978 --> 00:57:51.797
You don't think anyone could've liked me?

1269
00:57:51.822 --> 00:57:53.602
That's what we think.

1270
00:57:53.681 --> 00:57:59.118
I get better as time passes by and
I'm in a long-term relationship.

1271
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.993
These are instances when two people are
trying to figure out how they feel.

1272
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.402
Let's pretend that I met her for the
first time and I was interested.

1273
00:58:07.427 --> 00:58:08.617
Why does it have to be me?

1274
00:58:08.642 --> 00:58:10.591
Why does it have to be me?

1275
00:58:11.189 --> 00:58:14.544
- She doesn't want you pretending.
- You're the only female here!

1276
00:58:14.673 --> 00:58:17.664
- She doesn't even want to think about it.
- You're the only female!

1277
00:58:17.689 --> 00:58:20.767
- Don't pretend.
- That's how mad you get at women?

1278
00:58:20.845 --> 00:58:23.141
It's unpleasant for her to think about it.

1279
00:58:24.205 --> 00:58:25.774
She's offended by your suggestion!

1280
00:58:25.884 --> 00:58:29.454
- No wonder women think you make them
uncomfortable. - Why don't you get it?

1281
00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:32.594
Why would you be uncomfortable
when I'm saying it so nicely?

1282
00:58:32.619 --> 00:58:34.485
- But...
- Wait a second.

1283
00:58:34.783 --> 00:58:36.563
You're too much, too.

1284
00:58:37.017 --> 00:58:39.188
He was just using an example.

1285
00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:43.164
- She won't even let him use her as an
example. - She knows what she likes.

1286
00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:44.845
Let's say I was interested in her.

1287
00:58:45.158 --> 00:58:47.723
Somehow, we exchanged phone numbers.

1288
00:58:47.876 --> 00:58:50.384
But when I call, she doesn't answer.

1289
00:58:50.658 --> 00:58:55.352
When I call back a week later, I'll
talk to her and then get rejected.

1290
00:58:55.455 --> 00:58:59.548
That's when I should get it, but instead,
I call back a couple times more.

1291
00:59:00.345 --> 00:59:03.142
You're lacking a vital part of dating.

1292
00:59:03.837 --> 00:59:08.415
You do certain things to make
your counterpart fall for you.

1293
00:59:08.634 --> 00:59:12.009
- No, I don't. There's no push or pull to
me. - You don't know how to slowly move in.

1294
00:59:12.056 --> 00:59:13.915
You go forward without thinking.

1295
00:59:14.033 --> 00:59:16.898
You're a well-informed dating
professor, aren't you?

1296
00:59:16.923 --> 00:59:18.739
We have two professors?

1297
00:59:18.764 --> 00:59:22.158
Unfortunately, the two professors
are Jang-hoon and Sang-min.

1298
00:59:22.986 --> 00:59:27.235
You become well-informed when
you're tragically hurt by someone.

1299
00:59:27.353 --> 00:59:31.376
You learn a lot about love when
this and that happens in your life.

1300
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.938
- Of course, you do.
- What do you guys know anyways?

1301
00:59:34.095 --> 00:59:37.038
There's a famous proverb
about knowing pain.

1302
00:59:37.063 --> 00:59:39.649
I have questions until 2015!

1303
00:59:39.915 --> 00:59:42.063
I think we can call it day with these.

1304
00:59:42.275 --> 00:59:43.813
That was too funny.

1305
00:59:44.408 --> 00:59:46.774
Talking about love is the funniest.

1306
00:59:50.447 --> 00:59:52.032
(My daughter is too precious)

1307
00:59:52.095 --> 00:59:54.524
Honey, are you coming home today?

1308
00:59:55.283 --> 00:59:58.806
I'm your husband, can't I
ask if you're coming home?

1309
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.813
And also... Hello?

1310
01:00:02.212 --> 01:00:03.860
Hello? Sook!

1311
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.118
How does she always hang up after
she's done saying what she wants?

1312
01:00:08.337 --> 01:00:09.337
Geez, seriously.

1313
01:00:09.595 --> 01:00:11.696
Mom's not coming home today, dad?

1314
01:00:12.095 --> 01:00:15.270
Yeah. It's been 28-years
since she last came home.

1315
01:00:15.587 --> 01:00:17.024
- But, dad?
- Yeah?

1316
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.688
Do you still love mom when you
haven't seen her in 28-years?

1317
01:00:22.298 --> 01:00:23.298
Of course.

1318
01:00:23.548 --> 01:00:27.790
For 28-years, she's been automatically
depositing money into my account.

1319
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.766
You can't find a better mom.

1320
01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:32.626
I wouldn't care if she
didn't come for 280-years.

1321
01:00:32.908 --> 01:00:34.938
That's what our love amounts to.

1322
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:37.196
That's the kind of guy you should meet too.

1323
01:00:37.337 --> 01:00:38.860
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

1324
01:00:39.154 --> 01:00:40.154
I'm serious.

1325
01:00:40.556 --> 01:00:44.079
But, dad. I actually found a guy
I'd like to get married to.

1326
01:00:44.962 --> 01:00:47.618
A guy you want to marry? Really?

1327
01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:50.384
Yes, he's coming over to introduce himself.

1328
01:00:50.705 --> 01:00:53.997
- He's coming here?
- Yes, I wonder what's taking so long.

1329
01:00:54.095 --> 01:00:55.095
Really?

1330
01:00:55.587 --> 01:00:57.048
Hello, father.

1331
01:00:57.165 --> 01:00:58.813
- Who are you?
- Hello.

1332
01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:01.134
- I'm Yeon-soo's boyfriend.
- Hello.

1333
01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:03.054
- You're her boyfriend?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

1334
01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:04.079
- Yeon-soo!
- Hello.

1335
01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:07.095
- Who are these people, Yeon-soo?
- Who is he?

1336
01:01:07.447 --> 01:01:11.348
- Hello, father. - Why are you all
of you wearing shoes in my house?

1337
01:01:11.705 --> 01:01:13.595
You're wearing your shoes too, father.

1338
01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.446
I'm wearing my house slippers.

1339
01:01:15.619 --> 01:01:17.329
We're Americanized. Sit down, everyone.

1340
01:01:17.376 --> 01:01:19.751
- How's your health, father?
- Why did you invite so many people?

1341
01:01:19.845 --> 01:01:21.414
Sit down. You should sit first.

1342
01:01:21.439 --> 01:01:24.431
Hold on, Yeon-soo. I'm sorry
but can you guys leave?

1343
01:01:24.587 --> 01:01:27.930
- I'm her boyfriend. - I'm her
boyfriend. Don't keep calling her name.

1344
01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:30.351
Excuse me, we're not buying that.
Please, leave.

1345
01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:32.320
I'm not here to sell products.

1346
01:01:32.517 --> 01:01:34.899
How can you be disrespectful
if you're her boyfriend?

1347
01:01:35.072 --> 01:01:38.345
I didn't bring a present since
those gifts are useless.

1348
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:43.940
I wanted to give you a small apartment
building, it's already in your name.

1349
01:01:45.259 --> 01:01:46.852
Aren't you going too far?

1350
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.812
- There isn't any collateral
security on it? - No.

1351
01:01:49.837 --> 01:01:52.743
- It's free and clear.
- Only my name is on the title?

1352
01:01:52.768 --> 01:01:56.900
An apartment building for you to
enjoy during your retirement.

1353
01:01:57.376 --> 01:02:00.766
What's going on, Yeon-soo?
Who are all these people?

1354
01:02:00.853 --> 01:02:03.993
- Dad. - What?
- These are all my boyfriends.

1355
01:02:05.087 --> 01:02:07.462
- How could you?
- This can't be.

1356
01:02:07.658 --> 01:02:09.656
- You're amazing.
- What kind of woman, are you?

1357
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:13.227
- You're a player.
- It doesn't end here. There's more.

1358
01:02:13.705 --> 01:02:15.164
- There's more?
- I'm shocked.

1359
01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:16.189
Yeon-soo!

1360
01:02:17.759 --> 01:02:20.551
- There's more?
- I'm shocked. - Yeon-soo!

1361
01:02:22.134 --> 01:02:25.048
Who is he? He keeps following me in here.

1362
01:02:25.259 --> 01:02:28.148
I'd rather leave my own house.
This is annoying.

1363
01:02:28.173 --> 01:02:31.196
Men keep following me in here, Yeon-soo!

1364
01:02:31.408 --> 01:02:34.821
This is cheating! He gets
to wear a wig every week!

1365
01:02:34.923 --> 01:02:36.930
Isn't he the idiot from
the other neighborhood?

1366
01:02:36.955 --> 01:02:39.540
- I'm Yeon-soo's boyfriend.
- Take a seat first.

1367
01:02:39.736 --> 01:02:43.493
- I'm sorry, stop playing. I know
you're her uncle. - Don't say that!

1368
01:02:43.986 --> 01:02:47.274
Why do you keep calling me her
uncle, when I'm her boyfriend!

1369
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:49.087
You're her uncle!

1370
01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:52.110
Look at Yeon-soo! She's sitting next to me.

1371
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:55.954
Yeon-soo! Yeon-soo! How can
you date someone like him?

1372
01:02:56.048 --> 01:03:00.509
- You shouldn't hold arms with just
anyone, Yeon-soo. - He's so strange.

1373
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:05.321
I put Yeon-soo on my back and took her
up and down Namsan Mountain stairs.

1374
01:03:05.423 --> 01:03:07.735
You should sit next to your dad instead.

1375
01:03:07.923 --> 01:03:10.633
Think back to those days
and get on my back.

1376
01:03:10.658 --> 01:03:13.872
Remember how I gave you
that piggy-back ride?

1377
01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:15.767
You remember, don't you?

1378
01:03:16.322 --> 01:03:17.828
She doesn't remember?

1379
01:03:17.853 --> 01:03:19.501
Come sit over here.

1380
01:03:20.619 --> 01:03:21.619
I'm hungry!

1381
01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:26.001
I'm sure you're hungry.
Go get something to eat.

1382
01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:29.735
- Give him 2 meal tickets and
send him away. - Two won't do.

1383
01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:33.247
- You shouldn't press your luck, old man.
- Old man?

1384
01:03:33.564 --> 01:03:35.181
How many times will this be?

1385
01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:37.469
- How can you call me old man?
- Don't you have a conscience?

1386
01:03:37.494 --> 01:03:42.071
- I'm 10-years younger than you!
- How dare you sit next to my Yeon-soo?

1387
01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:43.884
I know you're married.

1388
01:03:44.173 --> 01:03:45.173
- Who?
- You.

1389
01:03:45.915 --> 01:03:49.501
It's better than getting divorced.
At least I look responsible.

1390
01:03:49.719 --> 01:03:51.821
Stop it. Being married and
divorced are all the same.

1391
01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:55.055
- It's better being divorced.
- How did you become her dad?

1392
01:03:55.251 --> 01:04:00.220
Sit down and come to your senses. Are
you all really my daughter's boyfriend?

1393
01:04:00.392 --> 01:04:01.742
- Of course.
- Yes.

1394
01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:03.649
Why are all of you here?

1395
01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:07.079
They're not all her boyfriends.
I'm her real boyfriend and...

1396
01:04:07.103 --> 01:04:10.437
- I wanted to introduce...
- He's been engaged 28-times.

1397
01:04:10.462 --> 01:04:13.267
- Really?
- He's only been officially divorced once.

1398
01:04:13.384 --> 01:04:14.578
This is getting out of hand.

1399
01:04:14.603 --> 01:04:17.431
I'd like to officially ask for
your daughter's hand in marriage.

1400
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.267
Father, Shintoburi!

1401
01:04:19.548 --> 01:04:23.071
Exciting Saturday, Burning Sunday.

1402
01:04:24.087 --> 01:04:27.431
That's all in the past. I'm
thinking about my daughter now.

1403
01:04:27.603 --> 01:04:31.048
The more I think about it, you
have unique taste, Yeon-soo.

1404
01:04:31.119 --> 01:04:32.492
You sure date strange people.

1405
01:04:32.517 --> 01:04:35.162
How audacious for you to say that?

1406
01:04:36.236 --> 01:04:39.017
Who is strange? Who are
you saying is strange?

1407
01:04:39.212 --> 01:04:41.657
I think you top the list for being strange!

1408
01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.930
Didn't you wear a doll's mask
and show up at my house?

1409
01:04:44.955 --> 01:04:46.297
That's how you came!

1410
01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:50.040
How come you're still wearing a mask?
Take it off!

1411
01:04:51.275 --> 01:04:52.626
I told you to take it off!

1412
01:04:52.798 --> 01:04:54.295
Shintoburi, father.

1413
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.556
Exciting Saturday, Burning Sunday.

1414
01:04:57.978 --> 01:05:01.149
Saturday night is exciting!

1415
01:05:02.228 --> 01:05:05.704
I might have a variety of boyfriends but...

1416
01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.431
I don't know which person I should marry.

1417
01:05:08.712 --> 01:05:11.962
- Can you choose your son-in-law?
- Okay, let's decide together.

1418
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.555
I'd like to introduce myself first, father.

1419
01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.345
I'm more than confident that I
can make Yeon-soo happy, father.

1420
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.470
I'll make sure she doesn't
have to move an inch...

1421
01:05:21.744 --> 01:05:24.306
and I'll take the responsibility
of doing everything for her.

1422
01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:27.337
He's just a burden, that's all.
He's not helping her.

1423
01:05:27.447 --> 01:05:29.497
I keep getting goosebumps
whenever I see you.

1424
01:05:29.522 --> 01:05:33.056
- Why, father?
- I know how hard it is for you these days.

1425
01:05:33.181 --> 01:05:36.236
You're in no situation to
love anyone right now.

1426
01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:41.783
- It's okay. - Try again and start
fresh when you're not in debt anymore.

1427
01:05:41.923 --> 01:05:44.389
- One person is out.
- My gosh. Geez.

1428
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.079
You don't sound so well.

1429
01:05:47.392 --> 01:05:49.938
How can you groan so
much just getting up?

1430
01:05:50.423 --> 01:05:53.149
- You should be young and healthy.
- My name is Seo Jang-hoon.

1431
01:05:53.236 --> 01:05:56.088
Sit down. Previously
married people are out.

1432
01:05:56.696 --> 01:05:58.360
Sit down. Sit down.

1433
01:05:58.658 --> 01:06:00.985
- When was he married.
- I know he was.

1434
01:06:01.103 --> 01:06:05.134
In my opinion... Excuse me, Yeon-soo's
uncle. Could you keep it down?

1435
01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.634
- No! Why do you keep calling me her uncle?
- Oh, my goodness.

1436
01:06:09.072 --> 01:06:12.295
He wore orange to make himself look young.

1437
01:06:12.994 --> 01:06:14.845
How can a 56-year-old wear orange?

1438
01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:18.837
- You're scaring me!
- Which university is this? University of?

1439
01:06:19.025 --> 01:06:22.243
- Where is that school. - There's no
school name, just "University of".

1440
01:06:22.298 --> 01:06:24.055
- Where is this school?
- What school is this?

1441
01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.931
It's supposed to say "Off"
but he's missing an "F".

1442
01:06:27.173 --> 01:06:29.407
His interest in education is off.

1443
01:06:30.907 --> 01:06:35.274
Father, I can accept the fact that
Yeon-soo dated before getting married.

1444
01:06:35.728 --> 01:06:39.259
For marriage, I'd like her to choose
someone that's similar to you.

1445
01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:40.875
I think you understand me best.

1446
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:43.212
To be honest, I've been
keeping an eye on you.

1447
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:45.303
I wanted to kick you out first.

1448
01:06:45.689 --> 01:06:46.689
Why, father?

1449
01:06:47.165 --> 01:06:50.008
I tried imagining our family
walking around together.

1450
01:06:50.033 --> 01:06:52.306
We'd be disrespected if we stood together.

1451
01:06:52.517 --> 01:06:55.209
- Look at the three of us.
- My goodness!

1452
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:56.975
Peekaboo!

1453
01:06:57.173 --> 01:07:00.240
- People might not like you
for saying this. - For what?

1454
01:07:00.408 --> 01:07:04.493
I can make these kinds of jokes since
I'm short as well. It doesn't matter.

1455
01:07:04.728 --> 01:07:05.728
Go ahead and sit down.

1456
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:07.072
- And, you...
- Yes?

1457
01:07:07.112 --> 01:07:10.619
I can't help but think
I'm looking down on you.

1458
01:07:10.814 --> 01:07:12.133
- Father.
- I'm looking down.

1459
01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:15.244
Your head is down, but
your eyes are looking up.

1460
01:07:15.837 --> 01:07:18.626
Are you sure, I'm not looking down at you?

1461
01:07:20.587 --> 01:07:22.752
I really think I'm looking down.

1462
01:07:22.822 --> 01:07:26.306
Father! Will you please give
Yeon-soo's hand in marriage to me...

1463
01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:31.454
for the sake of our next generation
and the baby's intelligence?

1464
01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:36.048
Sit down. I read all the rumors
about you, you're no joke.

1465
01:07:36.548 --> 01:07:37.548
Father!

1466
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.235
I'm Kang Ho-dong, the son of Korea!

1467
01:07:42.236 --> 01:07:46.188
Don't you feel secure just
by looking at me, father?

1468
01:07:47.548 --> 01:07:50.345
I'll make sure to protect Yeon-soo!

1469
01:07:50.384 --> 01:07:53.407
I think he's from the
University of Gorilla.

1470
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:55.243
It's Planet of the Apes.

1471
01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.617
Give Yeon-soo to me, father!

1472
01:07:57.642 --> 01:08:00.703
Okay, let's say you've been starving
on a deserted island for three-days.

1473
01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:03.868
A piece of chicken appears. Are you
going to eat it or give it to Yeon-soo?

1474
01:08:04.087 --> 01:08:06.385
- He might eat Yeon-soo.
- Forget it.

1475
01:08:06.697 --> 01:08:07.697
That's scary!

1476
01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.540
He'll become a cannibal!

1477
01:08:10.806 --> 01:08:12.893
He'll become a cannibal, for sure.

1478
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.656
I've been starving for 3-days?

1479
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:18.657
- There's only one piece of chicken.
- You're out because you hesitated.

1480
01:08:18.923 --> 01:08:21.602
- Starving for 3-days?
- You're still out.

1481
01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:23.002
This is confusing.

1482
01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:25.984
It looks like everyone is disqualified.

1483
01:08:26.290 --> 01:08:28.337
Looks like I'm the only one left, father.

1484
01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:32.201
You'd be disqualified even if all
these people weren't here. Sit down.

1485
01:08:32.415 --> 01:08:35.235
You'd be disqualified anyways.

1486
01:08:35.814 --> 01:08:40.173
"Real Men", "Law of the
Jungle" and "With You".

1487
01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.892
Every time I do a show
with you, I get cursed at.

1488
01:08:43.064 --> 01:08:44.476
You're the one, who was wrong.

1489
01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:48.126
Yeon-soo, how come you can't
bring home anyone suitable?

1490
01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:52.610
- That's not true, dad. - You can see
how strange everyone is, can't you?

1491
01:08:53.165 --> 01:08:54.165
- Look.
- Dad!

1492
01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:55.555
- What?
- I take after you.

1493
01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.134
What do you mean?
That's not true.

1494
01:08:58.455 --> 01:09:01.172
I never had a group, I only
dated one person at a time.

1495
01:09:01.197 --> 01:09:03.834
You're making us uncomfortable, father.

1496
01:09:05.118 --> 01:09:07.703
You really don't understand
what I'm saying, do you?

1497
01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:10.048
They might not look normal now...

1498
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:12.743
but if you take a closer
look, they're all nice guys.

1499
01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:14.618
How close do I need to look?

1500
01:09:14.767 --> 01:09:16.548
First, let's eat something.

1501
01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:17.986
- Okay.
- Eat together?

1502
01:09:18.165 --> 01:09:20.055
That's right, Yeon-soo
makes spaghetti well.

1503
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.416
- How do you know?
- I ate it before.

1504
01:09:22.665 --> 01:09:23.665
I ate it too.

1505
01:09:23.837 --> 01:09:26.181
- hold on.
- Yeon-soo makes good pollack roe pasta.

1506
01:09:26.337 --> 01:09:28.867
You make a mean palla. Squid ink palla.

1507
01:09:28.892 --> 01:09:31.259
Are you referring to
Paella, a Spanish dish?

1508
01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:34.298
It's not palla, but Paella.

1509
01:09:35.095 --> 01:09:37.517
- Your skirt is pretty, Yeon-soo.
- Yes, it is.

1510
01:09:37.806 --> 01:09:39.838
Is that the skirt I bought you?

1511
01:09:40.486 --> 01:09:42.048
- It wasn't you.
- It was me.

1512
01:09:42.361 --> 01:09:44.642
- My dad bought it for me.
- I bought it with my money.

1513
01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:47.975
Really? Did the skirt I bought
you, have a bigger rip in it?

1514
01:09:48.446 --> 01:09:50.631
He's digging himself a grave.

1515
01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:55.451
- Are you okay? - If I was her
real father, you'd be dead by now.

1516
01:09:56.048 --> 01:09:58.338
Seriously. I would've killed you.

1517
01:09:58.774 --> 01:10:01.272
I'm growing my stamina these days.

1518
01:10:01.297 --> 01:10:03.392
Kids these days are so fast.

1519
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:07.107
- You can't talk about bigger rips in
a skirt. - He's being fashionable.

1520
01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:10.470
Let's see if the pasta is
cooked before we eat the dish.

1521
01:10:10.837 --> 01:10:13.009
- How?
- We can try eating it together.

1522
01:10:13.462 --> 01:10:15.205
- With who?
- With you guys.

1523
01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.384
- You and me?
- You and me, you and me, you and me...

1524
01:10:18.658 --> 01:10:20.892
you and me, you and me, you and me.

1525
01:10:20.947 --> 01:10:22.845
(You and I will never...)

1526
01:10:23.048 --> 01:10:25.735
You can't lay things out
for them like that.

1527
01:10:26.197 --> 01:10:27.601
I'll use every line.

1528
01:10:27.626 --> 01:10:28.626
Say, "Dda".

1529
01:10:28.962 --> 01:10:30.790
"Dda"? Oh, okay. "Dda".

1530
01:10:31.205 --> 01:10:34.110
- "Dda", what? - You're supposed
to use that for a funny line!

1531
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.992
- You can't even use what they give you.
- Geez, seriously!

1532
01:10:37.017 --> 01:10:39.460
- Everyone understood.
- How hard could that be?

1533
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.469
I think missing that timing
was kicking your luck away.

1534
01:10:43.142 --> 01:10:46.259
What the heck? I really
didn't understand.

1535
01:10:46.595 --> 01:10:48.590
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1536
01:10:48.923 --> 01:10:50.657
I can't believe I missed that.

1537
01:10:51.111 --> 01:10:52.111
Look over here.

1538
01:10:52.329 --> 01:10:55.790
We're going to eat this together,
like the Peppero Game.

1539
01:10:57.056 --> 01:11:01.509
The person that leaves the shortest
length is the person that loves me most.

1540
01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:03.102
Wait a second!

1541
01:11:03.142 --> 01:11:05.790
- You're going to do this game
with everyone here? - Yeah.

1542
01:11:05.931 --> 01:11:08.954
Did you really think of this game for us?

1543
01:11:09.392 --> 01:11:11.751
- Yes, I thought of this.
- You wanted to do this?

1544
01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:15.360
- Yeah. - I'd like to be
first to try this with her.

1545
01:11:16.173 --> 01:11:20.149
Why? I'm upset. Why did you
think of this game, Yeon-soo?

1546
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.774
- Why?
- You don't have to do it.

1547
01:11:23.704 --> 01:11:25.462
You don't want to share your food, do you?

1548
01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.735
You're getting a lot of
static on your head.

1549
01:11:27.861 --> 01:11:29.868
Guys! Can you be quiet?

1550
01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:32.173
Only courageous men get a
beautiful woman, like me.

1551
01:11:32.259 --> 01:11:33.431
- Okay.
- Good.

1552
01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.923
I guess you're courageous, getting
a beautiful person like me.

1553
01:11:37.158 --> 01:11:39.220
- See if they touch lips.
- Okay.

1554
01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:41.239
Get ready. It's the first person.

1555
01:11:41.486 --> 01:11:44.126
Hee-chul isn't good at these games either.

1556
01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:46.290
- You start eating the noodle.
- Start!

1557
01:11:46.455 --> 01:11:48.235
Go little-by-little. Slowly.

1558
01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:52.879
Slowly. Whoa! You can't
put your hand up here!

1559
01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.860
(Are they touching?)

1560
01:11:56.931 --> 01:11:57.931
Did they touch?

1561
01:11:58.696 --> 01:12:00.915
Hee-chul is a total player.

1562
01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:02.775
(Stop it)

1563
01:12:03.447 --> 01:12:05.306
Good. They're done. Spit it out.

1564
01:12:05.876 --> 01:12:07.938
- This is Hee-chul's.
- Is this why you came here?

1565
01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:10.454
I'll put Hee-chul's here. Next.

1566
01:12:10.705 --> 01:12:14.219
- How come my turn came so fast?
- It's Yeong-cheol and Yeon-soo.

1567
01:12:14.244 --> 01:12:15.244
I'm starting.

1568
01:12:17.525 --> 01:12:20.195
Yeon-soo could cut it off
if she doesn't like him.

1569
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.220
She's aggressive.

1570
01:12:21.915 --> 01:12:24.101
- She's not cutting it off?
- I can't stand this.

1571
01:12:24.126 --> 01:12:25.852
I can't stand watching this.

1572
01:12:26.345 --> 01:12:29.337
Why did you do that? Father!

1573
01:12:30.259 --> 01:12:33.852
Isn't this cheating, father?
We're supposed to cut it.

1574
01:12:35.126 --> 01:12:36.759
Get going, move out of the way.

1575
01:12:37.017 --> 01:12:39.110
It could be over 6 inches long.

1576
01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:42.798
- Father!
- Excuse me, sir. When did you get there?

1577
01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:46.047
- You already reset everything too.
- He sure is fast.

1578
01:12:46.072 --> 01:12:50.868
Let's hurry it up. Why does everyone
want to play, when she's my girlfriend?

1579
01:12:51.517 --> 01:12:53.759
He's in such a hurry right now.

1580
01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:56.305
Do they look good together?

1581
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.330
(Laughing)

1582
01:12:59.095 --> 01:13:00.704
- Bring it here.
- Done.

1583
01:13:00.814 --> 01:13:03.767
- That's all you could do?
- I got embarrassed.

1584
01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:06.954
- What the heck?
- When did you become so shy?

1585
01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:10.642
- Next is Kyung-hoon.
- Yeon-soo is so aggressive.

1586
01:13:10.822 --> 01:13:12.320
Let me clean this dried pollack first.

1587
01:13:12.345 --> 01:13:14.571
Don't you have to try your best for games?

1588
01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:17.333
- Why is everyone acting so shy?
- I know!

1589
01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:19.517
Think about your son, Si-woo.

1590
01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
(Sits back down)

1591
01:13:20.915 --> 01:13:23.649
- Why are you so nervous?
- Aren't we professionals?

1592
01:13:23.674 --> 01:13:25.954
- Start!
- Be a pro, not an amateur.

1593
01:13:26.626 --> 01:13:28.273
They're getting too close.

1594
01:13:28.298 --> 01:13:30.571
- She cut it!
- She cut it off first.

1595
01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:33.711
She cut it off because you
came at her too fast.

1596
01:13:33.736 --> 01:13:35.829
- Can I try again?
- There's no seconds.

1597
01:13:36.033 --> 01:13:39.000
Professionals don't ask for second chances.
I'm going to try my best!

1598
01:13:39.025 --> 01:13:41.523
If you want to curse at me, go ahead.
I'm not scared.

1599
01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:43.337
He was married five-times.

1600
01:13:43.564 --> 01:13:45.423
He's already 56-years-old.

1601
01:13:45.962 --> 01:13:47.915
How could you be so bold to mention that?

1602
01:13:48.188 --> 01:13:49.476
(Well, that's true)

1603
01:13:52.673 --> 01:13:53.673
(Laughing)

1604
01:13:55.025 --> 01:13:56.571
What's wrong with you?

1605
01:13:56.955 --> 01:13:59.562
You're a well-informed
marriage professor too.

1606
01:13:59.587 --> 01:14:03.562
I'm going to try my best. I think a
professional should always try their best.

1607
01:14:03.587 --> 01:14:04.587
Okay.

1608
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.239
Can you go slowly? Don't come in suddenly.

1609
01:14:09.267 --> 01:14:11.086
My daughter is a bit aggressive.

1610
01:14:11.111 --> 01:14:13.351
- He's embarrassed about what he said.
- Start when he says, "Start".

1611
01:14:13.376 --> 01:14:15.540
- He said, "Start".
- That's it!

1612
01:14:15.853 --> 01:14:16.853
(Falls down)

1613
01:14:17.845 --> 01:14:20.239
- That's the end.
- You're finished.

1614
01:14:20.705 --> 01:14:23.375
- You're disqualified. - Someone
else's noodle is longer than mine.

1615
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.399
Almost eight inches.

1616
01:14:25.759 --> 01:14:27.860
- Look at this.
- It's really long.

1617
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.086
- Use a longer one, Soo-geun.
- I'll start short.

1618
01:14:31.111 --> 01:14:32.111
Here.

1619
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.012
- You're too much.
- You're cheating.

1620
01:14:36.813 --> 01:14:40.118
If that's how you want it,
use a short and thick one.

1621
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:44.239
(A heaping scoop)

1622
01:14:44.673 --> 01:14:45.673
Use that.

1623
01:14:47.563 --> 01:14:49.258
Is it too much? Is it too hard for you?

1624
01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:52.235
I'm sorry, but I might get indigestion.

1625
01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.032
Put it here, put it back here.

1626
01:14:55.298 --> 01:14:56.298
That's too much.

1627
01:14:56.423 --> 01:14:58.548
Tell us the winner, father!

1628
01:14:58.712 --> 01:15:01.907
- Did you win, Hee-chul?
- Yes, Kim Hee-chul won.

1629
01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:05.782
There is a penalty for the
person, who came in last.

1630
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.681
I'll hit someone with this
dried pollack as plenty.

1631
01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:10.461
Who came in last?

1632
01:15:10.486 --> 01:15:11.892
- Kang Ho-dong.
- Ho-dong?

1633
01:15:11.978 --> 01:15:14.305
- Ho-dong's is the longest.
- That's right.

1634
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:16.532
Come to the front, orange pig.

1635
01:15:17.455 --> 01:15:18.455
Orange pig?

1636
01:15:18.903 --> 01:15:21.278
(Somehow orange pig
sounds a bit refreshing)

1637
01:15:21.408 --> 01:15:24.087
- Use two, dad.
- It actually sounds delicious.

1638
01:15:24.283 --> 01:15:27.001
- Orange pig.
- I'm the orange pig? - Come out.

1639
01:15:28.173 --> 01:15:29.829
Fermented orange pork belly.

1640
01:15:29.923 --> 01:15:32.442
(Ho-dong prepares for his penalty)

1641
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:34.423
I have to hit your feet. Lay down.

1642
01:15:35.455 --> 01:15:38.156
It'll be hard for me to get
back up if I lay down.

1643
01:15:38.181 --> 01:15:40.773
You don't have to get back up.
Keep laying down.

1644
01:15:40.798 --> 01:15:42.473
Lay down and go to sleep.

1645
01:15:42.798 --> 01:15:44.188
He can't lay down.

1646
01:15:44.392 --> 01:15:46.946
Hold on, you need to hold the leg up.

1647
01:15:47.087 --> 01:15:48.583
I can hit him well.

1648
01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.118
You want to get hit from me.

1649
01:15:51.415 --> 01:15:53.204
You want to get hit from me.

1650
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:55.306
What did you do?

1651
01:15:55.673 --> 01:15:58.618
- What happened, Soo-geun?
- Lay down, everyone!

1652
01:15:58.673 --> 01:16:00.586
(The enemy is coming)

1653
01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:03.399
Did it hurt? No, it didn't hurt.

1654
01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:06.477
I'm sorry, only you got hurt, Soo-geun.

1655
01:16:06.837 --> 01:16:08.883
I'm sorry, only you got hurt, Soo-geun.

1656
01:16:08.908 --> 01:16:12.445
Anyways, Hee-chul can't get married to
Yeon-soo with this one competition.

1657
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:16.122
I have another test. You're too
precious for just one game.

1658
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:20.282
First, I raised my daughter preciously
because I didn't want her to get hurt.

1659
01:16:20.423 --> 01:16:24.688
That's why, I want to pick someone
who is physically strong.

1660
01:16:24.744 --> 01:16:26.671
- Men need to be physically strong.
- That's right.

1661
01:16:26.696 --> 01:16:29.918
I raised my daughter for
28-years with this body.

1662
01:16:31.259 --> 01:16:33.356
I don't know how hard it was raising her.

1663
01:16:33.517 --> 01:16:37.134
I can only give you my daughter,
if you come close to my body.

1664
01:16:37.736 --> 01:16:42.157
I'll make you my son-in-law if
you can win me at leg wrestling.

1665
01:16:42.205 --> 01:16:43.375
- With you, father?
- Yeah.

1666
01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.095
I shouldn't say this, but you have knees.

1667
01:16:46.947 --> 01:16:48.532
Of course, I have knees.

1668
01:16:48.611 --> 01:16:50.766
We didn't think you had knees.

1669
01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:53.345
You though I only had thighs?

1670
01:16:53.392 --> 01:16:55.930
You thought I only had thighs
and it connected to my feet?

1671
01:16:55.955 --> 01:16:58.937
We though your feet were connected to
your thighs and then, to your hips.

1672
01:16:58.962 --> 01:17:00.887
No one can look like that.

1673
01:17:01.837 --> 01:17:05.047
You're going to keep getting
disqualified, you XXXX!

1674
01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:07.664
(I can't have a jerk like
him for a son-in-law)

1675
01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.747
You're getting me annoyed.

1676
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.118
(He forgets Yeon-soo and
chooses laughter instead)

1677
01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.211
Look at his socks. Aren't those socks
supposed to only come up to here?

1678
01:17:17.767 --> 01:17:20.696
- Aren't those the same socks?
- You must have ankle socks on.

1679
01:17:20.721 --> 01:17:24.962
- How come his socks come up to his knees?
- Don't they usually stop here?

1680
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:28.743
How come you get more annoyed
with Soo-geun than anyone else?

1681
01:17:28.798 --> 01:17:30.687
Don't socks come up to here, father?

1682
01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.032
I didnâ??t raise her to see someone like him.

1683
01:17:33.497 --> 01:17:35.515
I can't she brought him
into the house. No way.

1684
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.329
The game is easy. Two people lay
down and latch their legs together.

1685
01:17:39.767 --> 01:17:42.648
Whoever makes the other
person fall is the winner.

1686
01:17:42.673 --> 01:17:46.446
Hee-chul, can you show us
an example with father?

1687
01:17:46.533 --> 01:17:49.454
- Hee-chul is disqualified since
his leg hurts. - His leg hurts.

1688
01:17:49.697 --> 01:17:52.930
- Is it because his leg is too white?
- No, he has a metal plate in his leg.

1689
01:17:52.955 --> 01:17:56.141
Really? Bring me magnets, let's
see if it attaches to him.

1690
01:17:58.392 --> 01:18:00.290
(Begins the test immediately)

1691
01:18:00.315 --> 01:18:02.008
- Hold still.
- Wait!

1692
01:18:03.571 --> 01:18:04.790
You scared me.

1693
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.946
- He's allowed to skip this game.
- You're not kidding around, father!

1694
01:18:09.548 --> 01:18:13.970
- Father! Shintoburi! - Exciting
Saturday... stop making me do it!

1695
01:18:14.658 --> 01:18:17.523
- Let's have preliminaries.
- The winner goes against father.

1696
01:18:17.548 --> 01:18:20.352
- I'll play against the winners.
- Sounds good.

1697
01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:23.891
- The way I see it...
- The weaklings can go first.

1698
01:18:23.916 --> 01:18:26.926
It's best for Kyung-hoon and
Yeong-cheol to go first.

1699
01:18:27.048 --> 01:18:29.227
- Okay.
- Yeong-cheol isn't that weak.

1700
01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.907
I'm considered weak in this crowd.

1701
01:18:32.806 --> 01:18:36.239
- Like this?
- Yeah, you have go down that far.

1702
01:18:37.248 --> 01:18:41.028
(The two-potential son-in-law
cautiously take their positions)

1703
01:18:42.173 --> 01:18:44.040
- Start!
- This is for real. Start.

1704
01:18:44.517 --> 01:18:46.657
- Start!
- This is for real. Start.

1705
01:18:47.064 --> 01:18:48.934
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

1706
01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:51.681
I know what to do now. I get it.

1707
01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:54.563
That's right, that's good.

1708
01:18:59.046 --> 01:19:00.516
(Rolls over)

1709
01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:02.798
Hey! What are you guys doing?

1710
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.501
Kim Yeong-cheol wins!

1711
01:19:04.705 --> 01:19:07.524
- Did I win?
- All you have to do is flip them over?

1712
01:19:07.775 --> 01:19:11.196
- That was it! That's funny.
- That was a big match-up.

1713
01:19:11.415 --> 01:19:13.611
- That was it.
- Thank you.

1714
01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:16.767
He's good.

1715
01:19:17.048 --> 01:19:19.493
- Up next is...
- Come here.

1716
01:19:20.376 --> 01:19:22.555
- Come here.
- Good. - Never mind, you come here.

1717
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.149
Let's go, Sang-min.

1718
01:19:24.369 --> 01:19:26.540
Try and win. His leg strength is gone.

1719
01:19:26.705 --> 01:19:29.149
- His legs are shot.
- Ho-dong isn't the same anymore.

1720
01:19:29.345 --> 01:19:32.962
We used to train by going down
on one leg and standing back up.

1721
01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:36.176
What was that?

1722
01:19:36.408 --> 01:19:39.172
- You used to do that.
- You used to be able to get up.

1723
01:19:39.197 --> 01:19:41.454
I might get hypnotized by your socks.

1724
01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:45.501
- He might have a snake in there.
- Lift your leg up.

1725
01:19:45.673 --> 01:19:47.445
You're disqualified if your
leg can't go up that high.

1726
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:49.587
Can you lock legs? We're not starting yet.

1727
01:19:49.689 --> 01:19:51.262
- Your legs can lock together?
- Yeah, it's possible.

1728
01:19:51.306 --> 01:19:52.306
Are you ready?

1729
01:19:53.064 --> 01:19:54.064
(Glaring)

1730
01:19:55.056 --> 01:19:57.142
Get ready! Start!

1731
01:20:02.184 --> 01:20:03.864
(Rolls away)

1732
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.547
(The game ends in less than a second)

1733
01:20:07.048 --> 01:20:10.227
Are you okay? You're fine
since you made people laugh.

1734
01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:12.735
Are you okay? Does your neck hurt?

1735
01:20:12.915 --> 01:20:15.156
I'm going to compliment you, for once.

1736
01:20:15.181 --> 01:20:17.516
- Good reaction.
- This is no joke.

1737
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:21.648
- Please, give me your permission.
- Who are you?

1738
01:20:21.673 --> 01:20:23.805
Sang-min tried getting greedy.

1739
01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.720
You can't help but flip over.

1740
01:20:25.745 --> 01:20:28.695
I'm proud all these men are
interested in my daughter.

1741
01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.055
- You can start the match, father.
- Okay, let's start them off.

1742
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.765
- Is this right?
- I don't think I can lock legs with him.

1743
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:36.418
- Let's try first.
- Put your leg up for me.

1744
01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:38.754
Wow, they can lock legs.

1745
01:20:39.494 --> 01:20:41.051
(The splits)

1746
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:45.071
- I can at least lock legs.
- Get ready!

1747
01:20:45.306 --> 01:20:47.372
He's too strong. Wait a second.

1748
01:20:47.528 --> 01:20:48.653
(It hurts for me too)

1749
01:20:48.903 --> 01:20:51.337
I'm sorry, but can I use both legs?

1750
01:20:51.892 --> 01:20:53.461
The length is too drastic.

1751
01:20:53.486 --> 01:20:55.032
It's more disadvantageous for me!

1752
01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:58.344
- You're hammering me down from above!
- I can't lock legs with you.

1753
01:20:58.369 --> 01:21:00.454
- Get ready!
- How is this possible?

1754
01:21:01.205 --> 01:21:02.205
Start!

1755
01:21:04.384 --> 01:21:05.668
He's flexible!

1756
01:21:08.244 --> 01:21:09.368
Who won?

1757
01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:11.270
Did Soo-geun win?

1758
01:21:11.295 --> 01:21:12.908
- He got flipped over.
- He lost.

1759
01:21:13.009 --> 01:21:18.165
- He got flipped. - This isn't fair. I
can't compete. His leg weighs too much.

1760
01:21:18.955 --> 01:21:21.071
My leg was stretched out.

1761
01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.134
Why was he screaming his head off?

1762
01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:27.609
I'll just lay here. Tell the
next person to come here.

1763
01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:29.367
The next person is Yeong-cheol.

1764
01:21:29.392 --> 01:21:32.696
- Yeong-cheol is next.
- One of us can go against Ho-dong.

1765
01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:36.570
- Excuse me. - I'll go against he
winner of this match or Ho-dong.

1766
01:21:36.595 --> 01:21:38.376
I'm sorry, but may I ask for a favor?

1767
01:21:38.658 --> 01:21:40.431
- Please, don't fight.
- No, we won't fight.

1768
01:21:40.509 --> 01:21:43.657
- Did someone say we're fighting.
- Don't get into a verbal fight.

1769
01:21:43.814 --> 01:21:46.774
He might be better since his
leg is longer than yours.

1770
01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:47.861
Get ready!

1771
01:21:48.017 --> 01:21:50.134
Jang-hoon's leg gets stronger at the end.

1772
01:21:50.173 --> 01:21:51.173
Ready...

1773
01:21:51.845 --> 01:21:52.845
(Start)

1774
01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:56.712
- I can lock legs. This is okay.
- It feels like you could win, doesn't it?

1775
01:21:57.017 --> 01:21:59.704
That's when it feels like
you could win, doesn't it?

1776
01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:02.672
(Starts slapping)

1777
01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:06.032
Jang-hoon! Please, save me.

1778
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.134
Jang-hoon! This hurts too much.
My neck hurts! Stop!

1779
01:22:10.728 --> 01:22:13.390
Why does it hurt so much
playing against Jang-hoon?

1780
01:22:13.415 --> 01:22:15.906
- You can't win.
- I can't come close to Jang-hoon.

1781
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.642
The heavier person has an advantage.

1782
01:22:17.775 --> 01:22:19.673
It's because Jang-hoon has long legs.

1783
01:22:19.783 --> 01:22:22.234
- This is the semi-finals.
- This will be a tough match.

1784
01:22:22.259 --> 01:22:23.610
I'll just go first.

1785
01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:26.532
Ho-dong can go against father first.

1786
01:22:27.181 --> 01:22:29.110
Go up against the orange pig.

1787
01:22:29.228 --> 01:22:31.798
Where did the pig go? Where did he go?

1788
01:22:32.212 --> 01:22:35.648
- A match made in heaven!
- Jang-hoon is going to win.

1789
01:22:35.673 --> 01:22:37.223
Hold on a second, father.

1790
01:22:37.681 --> 01:22:41.665
I'll move this over, so you don't
hit it when you roll over here.

1791
01:22:42.572 --> 01:22:46.181
I'm going to send you toward
the refrigerator, father.

1792
01:22:46.431 --> 01:22:47.431
Over that way.

1793
01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:49.727
Excuse me, Ho-dong. Ho-dong!

1794
01:22:50.134 --> 01:22:53.930
- Ho-dong! - Are you going to see
a funeral before getting married?

1795
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:57.274
I'm going to throw you with a slice.
Be careful.

1796
01:22:57.986 --> 01:23:01.688
I'm going to throw you
over toward the fridge.

1797
01:23:01.986 --> 01:23:04.458
- Jung-soo is strong.
- Lay down, father.

1798
01:23:05.244 --> 01:23:08.423
- Can my leg go up this high?
- You have to move lower.

1799
01:23:08.798 --> 01:23:10.282
Wow, this is amazing.

1800
01:23:10.548 --> 01:23:12.954
He'll have an advantage since he's shorter.

1801
01:23:13.494 --> 01:23:15.794
- Should I go lower?
- No, you're fine.

1802
01:23:15.931 --> 01:23:17.273
Get yourselves ready.

1803
01:23:17.298 --> 01:23:20.083
- Get ready!
- I'm more flexible than you think.

1804
01:23:20.283 --> 01:23:21.719
Wow, look at his calf.

1805
01:23:21.744 --> 01:23:23.177
Start!

1806
01:23:25.728 --> 01:23:26.728
Wow, look at his calf.

1807
01:23:27.165 --> 01:23:28.165
Start!

1808
01:23:28.416 --> 01:23:29.416
(Starts)

1809
01:23:32.505 --> 01:23:33.505
(Heave-ho)

1810
01:23:35.017 --> 01:23:36.017
(Screaming)

1811
01:23:37.837 --> 01:23:41.739
(He slams him down as
soon as the match starts)

1812
01:23:43.517 --> 01:23:45.001
(Knock down)

1813
01:23:46.033 --> 01:23:47.033
Father!

1814
01:23:48.212 --> 01:23:50.563
Father! You've gotten younger, father.

1815
01:23:51.126 --> 01:23:52.642
You've gotten younger.

1816
01:23:52.775 --> 01:23:53.775
Father!

1817
01:23:54.353 --> 01:23:56.228
You've gotten younger, father.

1818
01:23:56.384 --> 01:23:59.852
I feel like I've turned around,
but I don't know what happened.

1819
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.564
You can yell, "I give up".

1820
01:24:01.658 --> 01:24:04.453
Please yell, "I give up" if you think
you're going to lose, Jang-hoon.

1821
01:24:04.478 --> 01:24:07.677
I'll see first. You need to
come down lower, ho-dong.

1822
01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.720
Isn't this the first-time you
guys have battled like this?

1823
01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.626
(It's the strongest man winner versus
the man with the heaviest legs)

1824
01:24:13.712 --> 01:24:15.235
My glasses are ruined.

1825
01:24:16.095 --> 01:24:18.173
The six-footer might fly over that way.

1826
01:24:18.767 --> 01:24:21.036
Move those shoes away. I might fly.

1827
01:24:21.392 --> 01:24:24.226
This will be the perfect space
if he flips over this way.

1828
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:26.056
He won't bump into the wall.

1829
01:24:26.236 --> 01:24:29.352
Soo-geun, I'm going to lock
his leg and flip him over.

1830
01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:33.704
It'd be really funny if you flipped
him over and made him stand.

1831
01:24:34.798 --> 01:24:36.493
Watch carefully, father.

1832
01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:39.517
- Your hair is parted differently, father.
- What?

1833
01:24:39.806 --> 01:24:42.485
- Do what you want, I'm tired.
- Get ready!

1834
01:24:42.962 --> 01:24:43.962
Get ready!

1835
01:24:44.265 --> 01:24:45.265
(Start)

1836
01:24:46.987 --> 01:24:48.685
(A close game)

1837
01:24:50.778 --> 01:24:51.778
(Screaming)

1838
01:24:52.283 --> 01:24:53.618
He's lifting him up!

1839
01:24:53.939 --> 01:24:55.320
(He lifts up the giant)

1840
01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:56.923
He's lifting him up!

1841
01:24:56.948 --> 01:24:58.836
(He turns l180-degrees like a windmill)

1842
01:24:58.861 --> 01:24:59.861
He lifted him up.

1843
01:25:00.392 --> 01:25:03.083
It's no wonder he won the
strongest man competition.

1844
01:25:03.304 --> 01:25:05.915
(The strongest leg wrestler, Ho-dong)

1845
01:25:06.376 --> 01:25:07.829
(Jumps up and down)

1846
01:25:08.056 --> 01:25:10.860
(I kicked the giant with my foot)

1847
01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:17.392
- It felt different than anyone else.
- Ho-dong is so strong.

1848
01:25:17.798 --> 01:25:20.825
His strength is different
than other people.

1849
01:25:21.126 --> 01:25:24.212
How is this an important
factor for marriage, father?

1850
01:25:24.509 --> 01:25:28.954
Now that I think about it, it doesn't
have anything to do with marriage.

1851
01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:32.657
- You're right.
- He just looked strong and ignorant.

1852
01:25:33.142 --> 01:25:36.665
I want to thank all seven
of you for your hard work.

1853
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.704
All seven of you guys line up.

1854
01:25:38.845 --> 01:25:42.079
Yeon-soo will hug the
person she likes the most.

1855
01:25:42.415 --> 01:25:43.851
- Back hug?
- Yes, back hug.

1856
01:25:43.876 --> 01:25:46.335
- She can't hug you from the front.
- Close your eyes.

1857
01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:47.953
No peeping.

1858
01:25:48.228 --> 01:25:50.297
You choose, Yeon-soo. I'll stay here.

1859
01:25:50.322 --> 01:25:54.140
- Choose the person, who made your heart
beat faster. - Yes, the games don't matter.

1860
01:25:54.165 --> 01:25:55.852
- I'm going.
- Okay.

1861
01:25:56.205 --> 01:25:58.536
You're not going to use
"Match Made in Heaven's"...

1862
01:25:58.561 --> 01:26:01.450
show idea and have
father hug us, are you?

1863
01:26:01.966 --> 01:26:04.563
(Whispering)

1864
01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:09.977
(They do exactly what
Hee-chul was worried about)

1865
01:26:11.205 --> 01:26:13.305
I told you not to open your eyes.

1866
01:26:13.869 --> 01:26:16.649
My goodness. You sure are old, aren't you?

1867
01:26:16.845 --> 01:26:19.614
Don't blame your mishaps on me now.

1868
01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.938
- Why did you make me do such weird things?
- Sorry.

1869
01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:26.384
You shouldn't do everything she says.

1870
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.142
No, she came over and...

1871
01:26:28.501 --> 01:26:29.501
(Pointing)

1872
01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:32.749
(Her dad couldn't resist his
daughter's cutesy acts)

1873
01:26:32.822 --> 01:26:34.774
- It's real now.
- We're serious.

1874
01:26:35.314 --> 01:26:37.203
We're all on the same playing field.

1875
01:26:37.353 --> 01:26:42.378
Wait a second! Choose a person you didn't
like the most during today's games.

1876
01:26:42.403 --> 01:26:43.773
- And push him?
- Yes, push him.

1877
01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:44.999
Good, push him.

1878
01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:47.017
The person you liked the least.

1879
01:26:47.347 --> 01:26:50.773
(Being the least favorite is more nerving
than being chosen as her husband)

1880
01:26:50.884 --> 01:26:51.884
(Noise)

1881
01:26:52.001 --> 01:26:54.421
- Geez, that scared me.
- What was that?

1882
01:26:54.955 --> 01:26:56.579
The lights scared me.

1883
01:26:57.126 --> 01:26:59.023
It'd be funny if the light hits us.

1884
01:26:59.455 --> 01:27:00.455
Wait a second!

1885
01:27:01.861 --> 01:27:02.861
Wait a second!

1886
01:27:04.391 --> 01:27:07.531
What time is it? I think she pushed you.
I saw you moving.

1887
01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:10.509
- Didn't she push you?
- No, I don't think so.

1888
01:27:11.009 --> 01:27:12.894
(Everyone is confused)

1889
01:27:13.517 --> 01:27:15.546
You didn't play an active role today.

1890
01:27:15.619 --> 01:27:16.619
He wasn't active.

1891
01:27:16.853 --> 01:27:19.398
- Choose the person you like most.
- Make a reasonable choice.

1892
01:27:19.423 --> 01:27:22.884
- Try and be reasonable.
- Does she already have a winner in mind?

1893
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.765
- It's more fun disqualifying people.
- Keep pushing people you don't like.

1894
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:28.738
(She's starting to push everyone)

1895
01:27:29.862 --> 01:27:32.663
(Who will be the next person she pushes?)

1896
01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:35.456
(Jang-hoon is disqualified)

1897
01:27:35.595 --> 01:27:36.931
- Go out slowly.
- I'm sorry but...

1898
01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:39.407
Stop your whining and move on over.

1899
01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.267
- Move over.
- Keep moving!

1900
01:27:43.751 --> 01:27:45.531
- I wasn't...
- You don't get to talk.

1901
01:27:45.578 --> 01:27:48.645
I wasn't interested in
you from the beginning.

1902
01:27:48.923 --> 01:27:50.624
Who do you think you are?

1903
01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.368
who the hell are you? Hey!
You're not my style either!

1904
01:27:54.642 --> 01:27:57.610
You're kidding me. Hey! Forget you!

1905
01:27:58.533 --> 01:27:59.533
Geez!

1906
01:28:00.197 --> 01:28:02.610
He sure is a poor loser, isn't he?

1907
01:28:02.635 --> 01:28:05.438
We used to pretend there was a cliff here.

1908
01:28:05.486 --> 01:28:08.550
- Push another person.
- Let's see your falling performance.

1909
01:28:08.736 --> 01:28:10.316
There's a cliff here.

1910
01:28:10.478 --> 01:28:13.648
- It's Niagara Falls.
- You guys lucked out being chosen first.

1911
01:28:13.673 --> 01:28:16.181
I'm jealous. He's making us act now.

1912
01:28:17.197 --> 01:28:19.454
Let's see how they fall at Niagara Falls.

1913
01:28:20.105 --> 01:28:21.900
Why are you pushing me already?

1914
01:28:24.986 --> 01:28:27.710
I feel like it took him too long to fall.

1915
01:28:28.439 --> 01:28:30.288
You still fared better than most.

1916
01:28:30.577 --> 01:28:33.546
(Without delay, they begin
choosing the next person)

1917
01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:35.226
(Sang-min is chosen)

1918
01:28:35.468 --> 01:28:38.148
- You have to fall.
- Do your performance.

1919
01:28:38.499 --> 01:28:39.499
What's that?

1920
01:28:39.952 --> 01:28:40.952
Damn it.

1921
01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:45.577
(Trips over)

1922
01:28:46.538 --> 01:28:48.358
He fell over the rug.

1923
01:28:48.484 --> 01:28:49.882
He has no leg strength.

1924
01:28:50.007 --> 01:28:52.889
What are you reaching in the empty air?

1925
01:28:53.273 --> 01:28:54.857
Close your eyes, guys.

1926
01:28:54.882 --> 01:28:57.070
(There are only three left)

1927
01:28:57.492 --> 01:28:59.117
(Who will be disqualified?)

1928
01:29:00.031 --> 01:29:01.031
(Pushes)

1929
01:29:01.656 --> 01:29:03.632
Help me, Geunduun!

1930
01:29:04.163 --> 01:29:06.062
Whoa? Where's my cloud?

1931
01:29:07.877 --> 01:29:10.453
Wow, that's an amazing performance.

1932
01:29:11.026 --> 01:29:12.390
(Father is pleased)

1933
01:29:13.187 --> 01:29:16.468
- You knew you were going to get pushed.
- Yes, I knew.

1934
01:29:16.945 --> 01:29:20.288
Wow, look at how happy he is. You
can tell what he's thinking.

1935
01:29:21.132 --> 01:29:23.397
- He's so happy.
- This is more pathetic.

1936
01:29:24.498 --> 01:29:25.999
He's so happy.

1937
01:29:26.024 --> 01:29:27.513
Hee-chul might get nervous.

1938
01:29:27.538 --> 01:29:30.647
- I'm nervous, I am. - I'll give up
now. I'm satisfied with how far I got.

1939
01:29:30.804 --> 01:29:32.128
You can't do that.

1940
01:29:32.187 --> 01:29:34.894
- You can't do that.
- You want me to keep going?

1941
01:29:36.234 --> 01:29:37.670
You're not confident?

1942
01:29:37.695 --> 01:29:39.366
Do I push him or hug him?

1943
01:29:39.468 --> 01:29:42.359
- You need to hug him now.
- I need to hug him?

1944
01:29:42.484 --> 01:29:44.296
- Okay, guys.
- Close your eyes!

1945
01:29:44.436 --> 01:29:45.757
- Okay.
- I'm going!

1946
01:29:45.843 --> 01:29:47.764
- Okay, guys.
- Close your eyes!

1947
01:29:47.789 --> 01:29:49.248
- Okay.
- I'm going!

1948
01:29:49.273 --> 01:29:51.742
- Stop peeping, Hee-chul.
- That's right.

1949
01:29:52.523 --> 01:29:55.652
Alright, barbarian. No, I mean orange pig!
Stop crossing your arm!

1950
01:29:55.812 --> 01:29:58.152
(It's hard to take back
such strong name-calling)

1951
01:29:58.327 --> 01:30:01.382
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Don't cross your arms.

1952
01:30:02.413 --> 01:30:03.882
Okay, I'm going.

1953
01:30:03.961 --> 01:30:06.045
(It's really time for the last choice)

1954
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:07.286
Keep your eyes closed.

1955
01:30:07.311 --> 01:30:09.675
(Who will Yeon-soo choose?)

1956
01:30:11.097 --> 01:30:12.882
(Begins to move)

1957
01:30:14.206 --> 01:30:16.335
(They both hug at the same time)

1958
01:30:16.587 --> 01:30:17.587
(Laughing)

1959
01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.382
You're going to die now.

1960
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.734
Wait a second! I'm sorry!

1961
01:30:22.186 --> 01:30:23.933
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1962
01:30:24.757 --> 01:30:28.326
You know I'm not that kind of person.
I don't like doing this.

1963
01:30:28.351 --> 01:30:30.581
You know I don't do this.
Jung-soo told me to!

1964
01:30:30.804 --> 01:30:32.186
Jung-soo told me to do it!

1965
01:30:32.538 --> 01:30:34.398
He's sincerely scared.

1966
01:30:36.232 --> 01:30:38.044
(Please, help him)

1967
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:42.578
No, wait! I don't like this.
You know I don't like this!

1968
01:30:44.163 --> 01:30:46.312
(The real barbarian has here)

1969
01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.936
Look! It's the barbarian! The barbarian!

1970
01:30:50.093 --> 01:30:51.866
I'm really sorry, I am.

1971
01:30:52.007 --> 01:30:55.406
(Previews of our new transfer
student will air shortly)

1972
01:30:58.361 --> 01:31:02.398
(Beautiful melodies from the gayageum
pull at the men's heartstrings)

1973
01:31:02.895 --> 01:31:03.895
(Infatuated)

1974
01:31:04.593 --> 01:31:08.475
- Come on over here!
- Let's play piggy-back rides.

1975
01:31:08.952 --> 01:31:09.952
Hello.

1976
01:31:10.475 --> 01:31:12.927
I'm even pretty when I breathe,
my name is Lee Ha-nui.

1977
01:31:12.952 --> 01:31:15.022
(This is what "Honey" is like)

1978
01:31:15.139 --> 01:31:16.850
She came out because I called her.

1979
01:31:17.077 --> 01:31:19.630
He said, "I'm here, who cares
about anything else?".

1980
01:31:19.655 --> 01:31:21.585
- I'm so embarrassed.
- It must be a true story!

1981
01:31:21.718 --> 01:31:23.748
She graduated from Seoul University.

1982
01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:27.261
- She looks younger without make up on.
- Okay, we got it.

1983
01:31:29.001 --> 01:31:30.436
Isn't he being strange today?

1984
01:31:30.554 --> 01:31:32.537
He's putting so much effort in today.

1985
01:31:32.562 --> 01:31:35.179
- Are you happy that I'm here?
- I am.

1986
01:31:35.515 --> 01:31:37.124
I'm happy as well.

1987
01:31:37.389 --> 01:31:38.933
(We can't avoid the watch bet)

1988
01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:40.378
Forget that.

1989
01:31:40.609 --> 01:31:42.203
(This time, they bet shoes)

1990
01:31:42.343 --> 01:31:43.772
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1991
01:31:43.992 --> 01:31:46.210
- Just a bit.
- Go slowly, slowly.

1992
01:31:47.242 --> 01:31:50.015
- Ha-nui can't do this.
- This is too low.

1993
01:31:50.351 --> 01:31:52.035
(Stretching out)

1994
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:55.982
- She's going.
- I told you, she could do it!

1995
01:31:56.007 --> 01:31:58.183
(The games aren't over yet)

1996
01:31:58.639 --> 01:32:03.230
(Who will be the winner of the last
match, filled with made up dances?)

1997
01:32:04.157 --> 01:32:05.714
(I'm tired, I'm going to rest)

1998
01:32:05.773 --> 01:32:08.191
Try and close me up. It's
nice and cozy in here.

1999
01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:10.663
Let's move onto the activity!

2000
01:32:10.688 --> 01:32:13.302
("Ask Us Anything", every Saturday
nights at 8:50. Don't miss it)

2001
01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.894
Cham, cham, cham!

2002
01:32:15.445 --> 01:32:18.796
What are you doing? Why are
you looking at my chest?

2003
01:32:20.075 --> 01:32:21.075
How dare you!

2004
01:32:21.187 --> 01:32:24.710
That's where my eyes land
when you're my height.
