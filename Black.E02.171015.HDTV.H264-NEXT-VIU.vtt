00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:20.108
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:32.388 --> 00:00:33.487
I'm so happy.

3
00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:36.987
- Honey. - Yes?

4
00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:38.557
- I love you. - I love you too.

5
00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:46.968
Look at the sea!

6
00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:49.938
My, this is so nice.

7
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:51.707
It's dangerous.

8
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.387
Honey.

9
00:01:53.027 --> 00:01:54.198
No, honey.

10
00:01:58.407 --> 00:01:59.467
No.

11
00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.678
No, honey. No, don't die!

12
00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:04.307
Honey.

13
00:02:05.148 --> 00:02:06.948
No, no.

14
00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:14.558
Don't ever forget.

15
00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:18.327
You must not make eye contact with any human who's in love.

16
00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:22.198
If you do,

17
00:02:22.198 --> 00:02:25.028
a horrible tragedy will happen to you.

18
00:02:31.438 --> 00:02:34.207
(Black)

19
00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:42.348
Ma'am.

20
00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:44.487
What do you mean he died? Where's Moo Gang?

21
00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:48.857
Soo Wan.

22
00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:51.387
It's not true, right?

23
00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:54.628
This can't be happening. I've been misinformed, right?

24
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.957
Mother.

25
00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:02.538
No, no. That can't be.

26
00:03:03.568 --> 00:03:05.167
How...

27
00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.938
Do you know what I went through to make sure he could live?

28
00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:10.438
Where's Moo Gang? Where is my son?

29
00:03:10.438 --> 00:03:12.508
- Where is he? - Ma'am.

30
00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:13.577
Wait.

31
00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:16.318
There... He's there...

32
00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:18.147
He's alive.

33
00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:20.788
He's totally fine and alive.

34
00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:22.417
He's over there.

35
00:03:22.517 --> 00:03:25.587
What? You mean Moo Gang... Moo Gang is alive?

36
00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:26.628
Yes.

37
00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:29.658
What are you talking about? I confirmed him dead.

38
00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:31.998
I just ran into him in the hallway.

39
00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:36.198
Moo Gang!

40
00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:41.737
Moo Gang.

41
00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:46.577
Where is he?

42
00:03:47.348 --> 00:03:48.577
He was right there.

43
00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:53.417
I should die.

44
00:03:54.558 --> 00:03:55.857
I should die.

45
00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:58.058
I should die...

46
00:03:59.857 --> 00:04:01.998
According to the most recent update, Sergeant Han Moo Gang who was...

47
00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:04.698
said to have been shot to death in the hostage situation...

48
00:04:04.698 --> 00:04:06.468
that took place at N shopping mall in Seoul...

49
00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.498
is actually alive.

50
00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:13.267
Sergeant Han is being treated at Royeol Hospital at the moment,

51
00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:14.677
and the injury will not...

52
00:04:14.677 --> 00:04:16.107
- affect his life. - What? How...

53
00:04:16.107 --> 00:04:19.178
The Human Rights Commission has pointed out...

54
00:04:19.308 --> 00:04:21.448
that there might have been excessive use of force...

55
00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:23.017
Help. Help me.

56
00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:27.017
He's alive?

57
00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:30.318
Then why should I die? I shouldn't have to die.

58
00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:32.527
I'm going to live. I want to live.

59
00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:34.058
I want to live.

60
00:04:34.527 --> 00:04:37.097
Help. Help me, Dad.

61
00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:21.678
Is that possible? How can someone who's been shot be totally fine?

62
00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:24.407
- Ma'am. - Mother.

63
00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:39.387
What is this dog doing? It's disgusting.

64
00:05:39.988 --> 00:05:41.928
- What do you want? - You have...

65
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:43.798
such a nasty temper.

66
00:05:46.097 --> 00:05:48.397
- What is going on? You startled me. - Sorry, calm down.

67
00:05:48.897 --> 00:05:50.298
Who are you? What do you want?

68
00:05:50.298 --> 00:05:51.938
Let me introduce myself.

69
00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:53.637
My name is Oh Man Soo.

70
00:05:53.637 --> 00:05:56.337
My father named me Man Soo because he wanted me to live a long life.

71
00:05:56.337 --> 00:05:58.647
And this is my brother, Oh Sip Gyeon.

72
00:05:58.647 --> 00:06:01.217
He saved your life.

73
00:06:01.477 --> 00:06:02.517
He saved my life?

74
00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:06.787
Hey, are you okay?

75
00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.858
Did you really come for me?

76
00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:13.758
You little...

77
00:06:13.758 --> 00:06:15.227
- Are you a thief? - What?

78
00:06:15.227 --> 00:06:16.998
- That's why my house is a mess. - No.

79
00:06:16.998 --> 00:06:18.668
You worthless scumbag.

80
00:06:18.668 --> 00:06:20.698
Why would you break into someone's house?

81
00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:22.298
- Get out. - Wait.

82
00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.837
- Go. - Let me explain.

83
00:06:23.837 --> 00:06:25.568
The vet says my dog will die soon.

84
00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:28.277
That's why I came to ask you if he'll really die or not.

85
00:06:28.277 --> 00:06:30.407
What? How should I know that?

86
00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:32.048
Let go of me first.

87
00:06:32.448 --> 00:06:33.977
I saw you at the police station.

88
00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:35.748
You were suspected as a terrorist.

89
00:06:35.748 --> 00:06:39.048
You said you can see the shadow of death or something.

90
00:06:39.048 --> 00:06:42.318
I got your phone number secretly at the police station.

91
00:06:45.928 --> 00:06:46.988
Excuse me.

92
00:06:47.758 --> 00:06:49.097
Ms. Shaman?

93
00:06:50.928 --> 00:06:52.397
Let's go, Sip Gyeon.

94
00:06:57.097 --> 00:06:58.837
Hey.

95
00:06:59.068 --> 00:07:00.267
Dad.

96
00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:02.137
You're saying...

97
00:07:02.508 --> 00:07:05.948
that dog saved my life?

98
00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:07.618
What do you think? Can you see it?

99
00:07:08.647 --> 00:07:10.587
Is Sip Gyeon going to die?

100
00:07:11.948 --> 00:07:16.157
Do you really think I can see death?

101
00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:17.827
Of course.

102
00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:20.428
You knew that plane would crash. How can I not believe it?

103
00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:21.858
You recently became a shaman, right?

104
00:07:22.597 --> 00:07:24.128
You totally sounded like it.

105
00:07:24.128 --> 00:07:27.137
Has it been 3 months? Just 1 month?

106
00:07:27.137 --> 00:07:28.238
My goodness.

107
00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:29.897
You must be really good.

108
00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:30.907
Hurry.

109
00:07:30.907 --> 00:07:32.308
Do you...

110
00:07:33.008 --> 00:07:34.308
have a car?

111
00:07:35.407 --> 00:07:36.477
What?

112
00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:42.418
(Private Lee arrested at the scene)

113
00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:44.048
(Approval rate for Nam Joong Pyo has plunged.)

114
00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:50.957
What?

115
00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:00.397
Stop. Stop the car.

116
00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:06.037
Ma'am.

117
00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:08.137
You should pay for my service.

118
00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:09.407
What will happen to Sip Gyeon?

119
00:08:13.378 --> 00:08:15.217
He will live until he gets old and eats his own poop.

120
00:08:15.217 --> 00:08:17.948
Wait. Hey! My gosh.

121
00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:20.758
He's old and smelly already.

122
00:08:43.337 --> 00:08:45.408
Joon! You're alive.

123
00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:46.847
Who are you? Get lost.

124
00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.518
Joon, I'm sorry.

125
00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:52.518
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it.

126
00:08:52.518 --> 00:08:53.717
I said get lost!

127
00:09:11.038 --> 00:09:13.268
Joon. Joon!

128
00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:15.308
Joon.

129
00:09:15.308 --> 00:09:18.207
Joon, wake up.

130
00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:20.477
Help. Can anyone help me?

131
00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:23.477
Joon. Are you okay?

132
00:09:23.987 --> 00:09:26.288
Help. Help!

133
00:09:34.097 --> 00:09:35.627
Gosh, thank you.

134
00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:38.367
I heard you brought him to the hospital.

135
00:09:38.367 --> 00:09:40.097
How is Detective Han?

136
00:09:40.398 --> 00:09:41.837
He just fell asleep.

137
00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:44.607
By the way, how do you know him?

138
00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.678
What about you? Who are you?

139
00:09:49.977 --> 00:09:51.678
I'm his mother.

140
00:09:51.948 --> 00:09:53.207
His mother?

141
00:09:56.018 --> 00:09:57.648
Oh, it's his mom in Seoul.

142
00:09:57.648 --> 00:09:58.688
Excuse me?

143
00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:03.188
May I ask how you know Moo Gang?

144
00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:07.627
He and I met... Well...

145
00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:11.327
I helped Detective Han with his investigation before.

146
00:10:11.327 --> 00:10:12.928
I see.

147
00:10:12.928 --> 00:10:14.798
It's late. You should go home.

148
00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:17.268
We'll call you if he wakes up.

149
00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:18.808
Okay.

150
00:10:20.477 --> 00:10:23.178
You should go home and get some rest too, Mother.

151
00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:24.747
You must've been startled.

152
00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:26.477
Okay, I will.

153
00:10:29.648 --> 00:10:31.487
The head of neurosurgery wants to see you.

154
00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:40.087
She called his mom "mother".

155
00:10:42.298 --> 00:10:43.727
Is she his girlfriend?

156
00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:46.198
If it had gone only 0.5mm deeper,

157
00:10:46.198 --> 00:10:47.837
he would've died. He was lucky.

158
00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:49.638
He was also lucky that the bullet got stuck...

159
00:10:49.638 --> 00:10:51.507
instead of penetrating his head.

160
00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:54.107
- He needs a surgery... - The bullet is near his medulla.

161
00:10:54.107 --> 00:10:57.278
I might nick his cerebral artery if I operate.

162
00:10:57.477 --> 00:11:00.207
It's better to leave it in for now. Let's keep monitoring him.

163
00:11:00.207 --> 00:11:02.018
Wait, but...

164
00:11:02.018 --> 00:11:05.688
Well, I haven't handled a case like this before,

165
00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:08.757
but there's a case where a man lived until 80 with a bullet in his head.

166
00:11:08.757 --> 00:11:10.388
Don't worry too much.

167
00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:12.857
Does he have any other problems?

168
00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.298
His blood pressure and pulse are all normal.

169
00:11:17.298 --> 00:11:19.997
His gunshot wound is healing quickly too.

170
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:21.867
There's no more bleeding,

171
00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:23.737
and he doesn't have any infections.

172
00:11:27.977 --> 00:11:30.477
What happened?

173
00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:32.948
I heard your son was in an accident.

174
00:11:32.948 --> 00:11:36.617
Fortunately, it won't affect his life.

175
00:11:36.617 --> 00:11:39.518
Is that so? I'm glad to hear that.

176
00:11:43.558 --> 00:11:44.658
Doctor Yoon.

177
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.827
I heard you called his time of death.

178
00:11:49.097 --> 00:11:50.467
What happened?

179
00:11:51.227 --> 00:11:54.837
That's... He was clearly...

180
00:12:23.357 --> 00:12:26.698
I thought Moo Gang was dead.

181
00:12:29.997 --> 00:12:32.138
If he really had been dead,

182
00:12:33.737 --> 00:12:36.908
I would've followed him.

183
00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:46.587
Please don't say that.

184
00:12:46.587 --> 00:12:48.388
Moo Gang is alive.

185
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:11.977
I should give this back to him before I go.

186
00:13:14.178 --> 00:13:15.377
All right.

187
00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:43.077
Understood.

188
00:13:43.877 --> 00:13:45.408
I'll inject it.

189
00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:14.538
I'm sorry. Here...

190
00:14:19.577 --> 00:14:22.278
I can't believe how rude he was.

191
00:14:22.678 --> 00:14:25.518
He should apologize to me too.

192
00:14:25.518 --> 00:14:27.158
What a strange guy.

193
00:14:29.688 --> 00:14:31.528
(Royeol Hospital)

194
00:14:44.837 --> 00:14:46.038
You're awake.

195
00:14:46.337 --> 00:14:49.038
Do you have any pain? What about headaches?

196
00:14:53.308 --> 00:14:55.648
I'm sorry, Moo Gang. It's...

197
00:14:56.518 --> 00:14:59.847
It's all my fault. Please forgive me.

198
00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:03.957
Listen.

199
00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:07.558
I didn't approach you on purpose.

200
00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:09.997
I just...

201
00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:13.327
Who are you?

202
00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:15.568
What?

203
00:15:15.568 --> 00:15:17.038
Why does your appearance...

204
00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:23.178
make a change of feeling here?

205
00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:31.688
Why is this happening?

206
00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:34.018
Why?

207
00:15:43.597 --> 00:15:45.768
Why do I feel a flutter here?

208
00:15:51.107 --> 00:15:52.237
What...

209
00:15:57.548 --> 00:16:00.518
They say your heart recognizes the one you're meant to be with.

210
00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:02.548
Does this mean I'll die?

211
00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:08.087
What is going on?

212
00:16:09.558 --> 00:16:10.987
Is this broken?

213
00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:13.757
You told me...

214
00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:17.198
that your heart will recognize...

215
00:16:18.528 --> 00:16:20.467
the one you're meant to be with before anything else does.

216
00:16:25.438 --> 00:16:28.837
What are you talking about? I have no idea what that means.

217
00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:31.678
Get lost.

218
00:16:34.518 --> 00:16:35.648
I said, get lost.

219
00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:46.088
Yes.

220
00:17:48.088 --> 00:17:51.057
Looking at him up close, I can see that he looks just like he used to.

221
00:17:52.757 --> 00:17:55.628
I'm an idiot. Why couldn't I recognize him sooner?

222
00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:01.938
Joon.

223
00:18:02.838 --> 00:18:04.807
You grew up into a wonderful man.

224
00:18:48.118 --> 00:18:49.977
You weren't sleeping?

225
00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:54.588
Ha Ram.

226
00:18:55.658 --> 00:18:57.787
- Do you like me that much? - What?

227
00:18:58.628 --> 00:18:59.658
Yes.

228
00:19:01.027 --> 00:19:02.297
What do you like about me?

229
00:19:02.828 --> 00:19:06.128
Everything. From your eyes, nose, and lips to how nice you are...

230
00:19:06.227 --> 00:19:08.698
and how well you can fight, I like everything about you.

231
00:19:10.807 --> 00:19:13.067
I'll become your bride when I grow up.

232
00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:14.878
What?

233
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.408
My bride?

234
00:19:16.408 --> 00:19:19.848
That's right. So don't like that girl.

235
00:19:19.848 --> 00:19:21.047
That girl?

236
00:19:26.047 --> 00:19:27.688
Don't. I hate it.

237
00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:30.727
I don't want you to like that girl.

238
00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:34.957
I'll be 100 times prettier than her when I grow up.

239
00:19:35.158 --> 00:19:36.428
You don't even know her face.

240
00:19:36.428 --> 00:19:39.967
Right, so like me back instead of her, okay?

241
00:19:39.967 --> 00:19:41.898
I don't even wear my glasses these days...

242
00:19:41.898 --> 00:19:44.438
because you said my eyes are pretty!

243
00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:48.237
Okay, all right. I won't like her. Stop crying now.

244
00:19:50.707 --> 00:19:53.148
All right. I'll marry you, Ha Ram.

245
00:19:55.418 --> 00:19:56.448
Okay.

246
00:19:57.948 --> 00:19:59.017
Promise me.

247
00:20:05.527 --> 00:20:07.628
We even made a pinky promise.

248
00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:14.767
He grew up so well.

249
00:20:15.638 --> 00:20:16.737
The bracelet.

250
00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:26.747
My gosh!

251
00:20:30.217 --> 00:20:31.418
Who are you?

252
00:20:31.418 --> 00:20:33.418
Joon, I'm...

253
00:20:34.557 --> 00:20:36.888
What? You're that girl from...

254
00:20:36.888 --> 00:20:39.428
I'm... I'm Ha Ram, Kang Ha Ram.

255
00:20:39.428 --> 00:20:41.257
Don't you remember me? I'm Kang Ha Ram.

256
00:20:43.997 --> 00:20:46.967
Joon, do you remember the outcast at Moojin Elementary School?

257
00:20:47.067 --> 00:20:48.668
The shaman kid with sunglasses.

258
00:20:48.668 --> 00:20:49.737
- I'm... - Get lost.

259
00:20:50.368 --> 00:20:53.908
Joon, you don't remember me? That's impossible.

260
00:20:53.908 --> 00:20:55.138
I told you to get lost!

261
00:20:58.678 --> 00:21:01.348
I saw you letting that woman rub your chest.

262
00:21:01.777 --> 00:21:03.648
Do you get disgusted even when I just touch you?

263
00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:08.457
Then why have you been wearing this bracelet I gave you all this time?

264
00:21:09.918 --> 00:21:12.158
You confused me, jerk.

265
00:21:12.527 --> 00:21:13.957
You're such a jerk!

266
00:21:23.598 --> 00:21:24.868
Who is that girl?

267
00:21:35.618 --> 00:21:37.287
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

268
00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:40.418
He doesn't remember me?

269
00:21:40.957 --> 00:21:42.287
That is crazy!

270
00:21:46.858 --> 00:21:49.328
Gosh, where did I put it?

271
00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:55.168
The jacket.

272
00:22:04.108 --> 00:22:05.178
Yes.

273
00:22:24.898 --> 00:22:26.198
Hey, you!

274
00:22:29.297 --> 00:22:30.707
Gosh, that startled me.

275
00:22:32.307 --> 00:22:33.507
That's...

276
00:22:34.507 --> 00:22:37.178
Well, what are you doing now?

277
00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:51.457
Move.

278
00:22:52.158 --> 00:22:54.158
Where are you going? I have to talk to you about something!

279
00:22:54.158 --> 00:22:55.557
Where are you going?

280
00:22:55.557 --> 00:22:56.698
Leave me alone. I don't know.

281
00:22:56.698 --> 00:22:58.497
You're a patient. You can't just leave like that.

282
00:22:58.598 --> 00:23:00.497
Joon, Joon.

283
00:23:00.638 --> 00:23:02.237
I'm asking you where you're going.

284
00:23:02.997 --> 00:23:04.267
Joon!

285
00:23:14.777 --> 00:23:17.747
Gosh, where are you going right now?

286
00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:19.448
Joon.

287
00:23:19.848 --> 00:23:21.658
Joon! My gosh.

288
00:23:23.717 --> 00:23:26.588
What do you want? Why do you keep following me around?

289
00:23:26.588 --> 00:23:27.628
What is your problem?

290
00:23:27.628 --> 00:23:29.098
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

291
00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:32.668
If you're embarrassed of me, just tell me so.

292
00:23:33.368 --> 00:23:34.737
You recognized me...

293
00:23:35.338 --> 00:23:37.507
when you saw me at the burger place, didn't you?

294
00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:39.737
You must've come to see me knowing who I am.

295
00:23:40.477 --> 00:23:41.678
I knew it.

296
00:23:43.477 --> 00:23:45.707
The spiel about how my ability is a blessing, not a curse.

297
00:23:45.878 --> 00:23:48.777
That's exactly what you said to me right before you moved to Seoul.

298
00:23:49.948 --> 00:23:52.487
Right, the pieces of the puzzle are finally falling into place.

299
00:23:52.487 --> 00:23:55.757
I mean, I'm probably the only person in the world with such ability.

300
00:23:56.418 --> 00:23:57.928
There's no way you can't recognize me.

301
00:23:57.928 --> 00:24:01.428
Joon, why did you pretend you didn't know me?

302
00:24:01.428 --> 00:24:04.168
Why? Because I'm in this mess when we met again after 20 years?

303
00:24:04.168 --> 00:24:05.527
Are you disappointed and embarrassed of me?

304
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.967
Was it because you're embarrassed of me?

305
00:24:06.967 --> 00:24:08.237
How... My gosh!

306
00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:13.807
What are you doing?

307
00:24:15.078 --> 00:24:16.438
What are you doing now?

308
00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:27.517
Joon, Joon!

309
00:24:37.027 --> 00:24:38.467
Go. Hurry up!

310
00:24:39.698 --> 00:24:42.237
What are you waiting for? Let's go! That girl is following me. Hurry up!

311
00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:44.408
I can't go anywhere until you pay your fare.

312
00:24:44.408 --> 00:24:46.737
- What? - Get off if you have no money.

313
00:24:49.138 --> 00:24:50.408
It's for two people.

314
00:25:07.898 --> 00:25:09.358
We can't find him anywhere.

315
00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:13.368
He's in no condition to leave the hospital.

316
00:25:14.698 --> 00:25:17.638
You guys didn't even notice him leaving. What were you all doing?

317
00:25:17.638 --> 00:25:18.868
We're sorry.

318
00:25:22.378 --> 00:25:23.578
Thank you for calling Royeol Hospital.

319
00:25:25.477 --> 00:25:26.578
Pardon me?

320
00:25:27.448 --> 00:25:28.977
Doctor, your son is...

321
00:25:31.688 --> 00:25:32.888
Moo Gang.

322
00:25:33.088 --> 00:25:35.287
Hello, I'm not Han Moo Gang.

323
00:25:35.717 --> 00:25:39.658
I'm the girl who brought him to the hospital yesterday.

324
00:25:39.658 --> 00:25:42.828
Yes, he's on a bus now. It looks like he's going somewhere.

325
00:25:43.358 --> 00:25:45.128
Where are you going?

326
00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:52.767
I keep telling him to go back to the hospital, but he's not listening.

327
00:25:53.977 --> 00:25:58.707
Yes, I'll call you again as soon as we get off the bus. Okay.

328
00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:04.517
Look. Stop trying to look cool, and hold on to the strap.

329
00:26:04.517 --> 00:26:06.247
You might tumble.

330
00:26:06.648 --> 00:26:07.717
No.

331
00:26:08.557 --> 00:26:10.787
How can I lose this woman?

332
00:26:10.787 --> 00:26:12.787
She's so annoying.

333
00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:13.858
Oh, gosh.

334
00:26:15.928 --> 00:26:18.828
What did I tell you? I told you to hold on to the strap.

335
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:21.497
Why are you so stubborn when your legs are so weak?

336
00:26:21.537 --> 00:26:24.207
Do I look like such a weak person?

337
00:26:24.938 --> 00:26:26.967
I don't rely on these things!

338
00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:28.878
- Oh, my. - Hey.

339
00:26:29.507 --> 00:26:31.578
You have time for bluffing,

340
00:26:31.707 --> 00:26:33.608
and you don't have time for an apology?

341
00:26:34.118 --> 00:26:35.118
What's your problem?

342
00:26:35.118 --> 00:26:37.547
You just stepped on my foot.

343
00:26:37.547 --> 00:26:39.588
You should apologize.

344
00:26:39.987 --> 00:26:41.158
Does it hurt?

345
00:26:41.158 --> 00:26:42.158
Of course.

346
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:45.928
If I apologize, would it hurt less?

347
00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:46.957
What?

348
00:26:47.957 --> 00:26:49.858
- Would it hurt less? - What did you say?

349
00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:51.598
I can't believe this jerk!

350
00:26:51.598 --> 00:26:54.267
I'm sorry, sir. This man injured his head in an accident.

351
00:26:54.267 --> 00:26:56.098
He's not in a good state.

352
00:26:56.098 --> 00:26:59.438
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

353
00:26:59.507 --> 00:27:01.678
He's supposed to be in a hospital. I'm sorry.

354
00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:03.537
Come this way. Gosh, come on now.

355
00:27:03.537 --> 00:27:05.307
I told you to hold on to it.

356
00:27:05.307 --> 00:27:07.378
Hold on to this for goodness' sake.

357
00:27:09.517 --> 00:27:12.448
When will these people get up?

358
00:27:13.487 --> 00:27:14.588
Hey.

359
00:27:15.557 --> 00:27:17.928
Hey, wake up. I said wake up.

360
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.727
Do you think this is your own room?

361
00:27:19.727 --> 00:27:20.957
What are you doing?

362
00:27:20.957 --> 00:27:22.957
Wake up. Wake up!

363
00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:24.128
Who are you?

364
00:27:24.128 --> 00:27:26.868
I've been watching. You two have been sitting down the longest.

365
00:27:26.868 --> 00:27:28.198
Get up.

366
00:27:28.398 --> 00:27:29.598
Get off already!

367
00:27:29.598 --> 00:27:31.037
What's wrong with you?

368
00:27:31.037 --> 00:27:34.007
Look. I'm getting off now. Just sit here,

369
00:27:34.007 --> 00:27:35.807
and stop making noises.

370
00:27:37.477 --> 00:27:40.547
I don't take orders from humans.

371
00:27:42.477 --> 00:27:43.717
Oh, goodness.

372
00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:56.797
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

373
00:27:58.628 --> 00:28:00.638
Oh, my back. Gosh, my legs.

374
00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:03.368
Goodness, this is killing me.

375
00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:07.378
Don't worry. You won't die soon.

376
00:28:07.807 --> 00:28:08.838
Gosh.

377
00:28:10.138 --> 00:28:12.477
Old people should just die.

378
00:28:14.078 --> 00:28:15.777
My gosh.

379
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.987
Why are you hitting me, old lady?

380
00:28:18.317 --> 00:28:21.957
Goodness. Young people these days are...

381
00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:23.957
just so rude.

382
00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:27.727
What a rude person.

383
00:28:27.727 --> 00:28:29.257
How uncivil.

384
00:28:29.257 --> 00:28:32.227
You brat. Don't you have parents?

385
00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:33.727
No. What are you going to do?

386
00:28:33.727 --> 00:28:35.098
Gosh, he startled me.

387
00:28:38.707 --> 00:28:39.707
I'm sorry...

388
00:28:40.977 --> 00:28:42.408
Oh, gosh.

389
00:28:45.108 --> 00:28:48.047
I'm sorry.

390
00:28:48.148 --> 00:28:50.178
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

391
00:28:51.047 --> 00:28:52.188
Joon.

392
00:28:52.717 --> 00:28:55.717
Ma'am. Where did he...

393
00:28:57.457 --> 00:28:58.527
Joon!

394
00:29:04.328 --> 00:29:05.828
Oh, goodness!

395
00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:08.767
Gosh, it got on my hand.

396
00:29:10.938 --> 00:29:12.908
What? Moo Gang.

397
00:29:12.967 --> 00:29:15.138
Why are you coming out of there?

398
00:29:15.277 --> 00:29:17.037
Hey. Moo Gang.

399
00:29:17.037 --> 00:29:20.078
Are... Are you okay?

400
00:29:20.307 --> 00:29:23.618
Hey, I thought you died...

401
00:29:24.717 --> 00:29:25.747
(Oh So Tae)

402
00:29:26.918 --> 00:29:28.817
- Get it off of me. - What?

403
00:29:29.188 --> 00:29:30.557
How dirty.

404
00:29:32.128 --> 00:29:34.057
Oh, I'm sorry.

405
00:29:34.057 --> 00:29:36.997
I thought you were staying in a hospital.

406
00:29:36.997 --> 00:29:38.398
When did you get here?

407
00:29:38.567 --> 00:29:41.267
You're even wearing a hospital gown.

408
00:29:44.007 --> 00:29:45.108
Are you a detective?

409
00:29:45.108 --> 00:29:46.908
What?

410
00:29:47.537 --> 00:29:49.037
Have you gone crazy?

411
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:51.448
I'm your senior. How dare you?

412
00:29:54.047 --> 00:29:55.047
What?

413
00:29:55.717 --> 00:29:57.787
What is it? What?

414
00:29:58.688 --> 00:30:00.557
Anyhow, you're a detective.

415
00:30:01.858 --> 00:30:02.888
Follow me.

416
00:30:02.888 --> 00:30:04.957
How dare you tell me to...

417
00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:09.158
Wait. Hold on a second.

418
00:30:09.158 --> 00:30:11.067
Gosh, it hurts.

419
00:30:13.868 --> 00:30:15.537
Here it is.

420
00:30:15.698 --> 00:30:17.507
Why do you need this address?

421
00:30:17.507 --> 00:30:18.567
Write it down.

422
00:30:20.237 --> 00:30:21.878
Gosh, you rude brat.

423
00:30:21.878 --> 00:30:26.007
Hey, do you think I'm a pushover?

424
00:30:31.487 --> 00:30:32.717
I said write it down.

425
00:30:32.888 --> 00:30:34.358
My gosh.

426
00:30:38.658 --> 00:30:40.128
Fine.

427
00:30:40.227 --> 00:30:43.527
I'm only doing it because you injured your head...

428
00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:45.967
and you're clearly not okay yet.

429
00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:48.467
There won't be a next time.

430
00:30:52.067 --> 00:30:54.277
Hey!

431
00:30:54.277 --> 00:30:57.678
You think I'm a pushover, don't you?

432
00:30:57.747 --> 00:31:01.348
He's not in his right mind. What should I do about him?

433
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:04.217
Hold on. What was his mom's phone number?

434
00:31:04.217 --> 00:31:05.487
Let's see.

435
00:31:09.358 --> 00:31:11.658
Hello? This is Oh So Tae of...

436
00:31:12.888 --> 00:31:15.398
What? A murder?

437
00:31:20.297 --> 00:31:22.338
I'm sure he will show up here.

438
00:31:46.027 --> 00:31:47.727
Are you okay?

439
00:31:47.727 --> 00:31:49.057
You must be cold.

440
00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:50.967
Mind your own business. I'm busy.

441
00:31:51.368 --> 00:31:52.727
Why are you so busy?

442
00:31:52.727 --> 00:31:54.868
I'm tailing someone. Stop talking to me.

443
00:31:55.938 --> 00:31:58.307
Whom? Whom are you tailing?

444
00:31:59.707 --> 00:32:00.807
You.

445
00:32:10.517 --> 00:32:11.747
What is this?

446
00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:13.918
Get yourself some food with this.

447
00:32:15.257 --> 00:32:17.287
You remind me of my late son.

448
00:32:29.774 --> 00:32:31.113
Ma'am.

449
00:32:31.343 --> 00:32:32.597
Today is the appointed day.

450
00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:33.968
Did you get the money ready?

451
00:32:34.313 --> 00:32:36.744
I don't get many customers these days.

452
00:32:40.313 --> 00:32:41.853
What? What are you doing?

453
00:32:42.454 --> 00:32:43.653
Where are we going?

454
00:32:45.593 --> 00:32:47.194
He finally showed up.

455
00:32:57.304 --> 00:32:58.434
What are you doing?

456
00:33:01.903 --> 00:33:05.343
That's right. He would need money to stay in hiding.

457
00:33:11.367 --> 00:33:14.599
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E02 Black "Reborn"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

458
00:33:22.318 --> 00:33:23.379
Who are you?

459
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.618
What do you think?

460
00:33:25.818 --> 00:33:27.459
You punk.

461
00:33:30.689 --> 00:33:32.859
I guess you know how to fight a little.

462
00:33:33.129 --> 00:33:34.999
Gosh, all right.

463
00:33:35.258 --> 00:33:38.028
I won't go easy on you this time.

464
00:33:38.868 --> 00:33:41.738
I won't go easy on you now, you punk.

465
00:33:47.479 --> 00:33:49.979
Why... Why are you doing this to me?

466
00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:55.149
What? I got the wrong person.

467
00:33:58.149 --> 00:34:00.388
Hey! Who are you?

468
00:34:09.729 --> 00:34:11.099
Who are you?

469
00:34:11.229 --> 00:34:12.769
Are you an underling of Gal Chi?

470
00:34:13.568 --> 00:34:16.399
Gosh, he doesn't know a thing about business ethics.

471
00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:17.939
Let me say this again.

472
00:34:17.939 --> 00:34:21.338
This area belongs to us.

473
00:34:21.338 --> 00:34:22.338
Do you hear me?

474
00:34:22.338 --> 00:34:23.979
Move, Baldy.

475
00:34:25.948 --> 00:34:27.278
"Baldy"?

476
00:34:27.278 --> 00:34:29.718
Are you begging us to kill you?

477
00:34:29.718 --> 00:34:31.618
Boss, we need to teach him a lesson.

478
00:34:31.618 --> 00:34:33.019
Wait.

479
00:34:33.019 --> 00:34:35.388
Isn't he the detective from the other day?

480
00:34:35.758 --> 00:34:37.758
What? Is he a detective?

481
00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:40.798
Don't you remember him? At the barbecue restaurant.

482
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:48.999
Oh, that's right. You're that loser.

483
00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:51.368
That was you.

484
00:34:51.809 --> 00:34:53.508
It looks like he's sick.

485
00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:01.218
Come on. Where do you think you're going?

486
00:35:01.218 --> 00:35:04.519
You beat my guy into a pulp.

487
00:35:04.548 --> 00:35:08.189
You should either apologize or compensate for what you did.

488
00:35:08.988 --> 00:35:10.059
Don't you agree?

489
00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:12.088
He's the one who confused me by taking the money.

490
00:35:13.629 --> 00:35:14.658
Get lost.

491
00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:18.468
I don't think this detective gets my message.

492
00:35:19.099 --> 00:35:20.129
Go get him!

493
00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:49.028
- My gosh. - Look at him.

494
00:35:49.198 --> 00:35:51.068
- How incredible. - My goodness.

495
00:35:51.068 --> 00:35:53.229
- He's a great fighter. - How impressive.

496
00:35:53.698 --> 00:35:55.539
- Look at him. - My gosh.

497
00:35:56.769 --> 00:35:58.508
My goodness.

498
00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:02.408
I'm so good.

499
00:36:15.189 --> 00:36:17.829
His sister apparently goes to this school.

500
00:36:47.689 --> 00:36:49.519
My goodness gracious.

501
00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:52.428
Sir, it fits you perfectly.

502
00:36:52.758 --> 00:36:54.698
You look like a model.

503
00:36:57.068 --> 00:36:58.169
How much is it?

504
00:36:58.468 --> 00:36:59.499
Let me see.

505
00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:02.568
With a 10 percent discount, it costs 2,370 dollars.

506
00:37:17.088 --> 00:37:18.189
Why?

507
00:37:19.249 --> 00:37:20.419
Do I need to give you more?

508
00:37:20.419 --> 00:37:21.689
Sir.

509
00:37:39.908 --> 00:37:41.379
What?

510
00:37:41.638 --> 00:37:43.948
Where did he go? What happened?

511
00:37:43.948 --> 00:37:46.979
- I completely failed this year. - Me too.

512
00:37:47.118 --> 00:37:48.379
- Whatever. - My gosh.

513
00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:50.519
What was that sound?

514
00:37:50.749 --> 00:37:52.448
What's a guy doing here?

515
00:37:57.059 --> 00:37:58.158
My gosh, that startled me.

516
00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:00.599
What's their problem?

517
00:38:01.359 --> 00:38:03.528
You look completely normal.

518
00:38:03.528 --> 00:38:05.999
I can't believe you acted like a pervert in the girls' bathroom.

519
00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:09.468
"Pervert"?

520
00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:11.939
What did that mean again?

521
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:15.479
I can't remember what it meant.

522
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:22.218
Hey, hey! Close them.

523
00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:24.649
I said, close them.

524
00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:27.988
Close what? I'm not a door.

525
00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:31.189
My gosh, what a lunatic.

526
00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.698
I can't even be bothered to swear at you.

527
00:38:34.658 --> 00:38:35.758
What's your name?

528
00:38:38.028 --> 00:38:39.368
Tell me your name!

529
00:38:44.368 --> 00:38:45.539
Han...

530
00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:47.109
What was it?

531
00:38:48.508 --> 00:38:50.338
Oh, right. Detective Han.

532
00:38:50.649 --> 00:38:51.709
"Detective Han"?

533
00:38:51.709 --> 00:38:54.218
Is your name Detective? That's too grand of a name for you.

534
00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:55.579
What's your social security number?

535
00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:57.718
"Social security number"?

536
00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:01.718
Well, I'm not a member of this society.

537
00:39:03.519 --> 00:39:05.888
Are you trying to pick a fight with me or what?

538
00:39:08.629 --> 00:39:10.099
Where are you going? Hey!

539
00:39:11.868 --> 00:39:13.568
What? What are you doing?

540
00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:16.099
What's your problem?

541
00:39:21.908 --> 00:39:23.379
You punk.

542
00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:25.609
Do you know this guy?

543
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:28.118
- You punk. - What's your problem?

544
00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:30.849
- My gosh. - Put it down.

545
00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:31.919
- Hey! - Stop it.

546
00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:33.189
Detective Han?

547
00:39:34.388 --> 00:39:36.088
I can't understand it either.

548
00:39:36.088 --> 00:39:38.289
But he got caught red-handed.

549
00:39:38.488 --> 00:39:39.758
Okay, sir.

550
00:39:40.399 --> 00:39:42.658
Detective Han. Detective Han!

551
00:39:43.698 --> 00:39:45.868
Here, you need to take this call. It's Crazy...

552
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:48.638
It's Detective Na.

553
00:39:48.698 --> 00:39:50.099
I don't know who he is.

554
00:39:50.198 --> 00:39:52.838
He's your partner, Detective Na. Hurry up, and take the phone.

555
00:39:57.309 --> 00:39:58.408
What do you want?

556
00:39:58.809 --> 00:39:59.979
What do you want?

557
00:40:01.218 --> 00:40:02.818
You're holding it upside down.

558
00:40:03.678 --> 00:40:04.789
It's the other way around.

559
00:40:07.689 --> 00:40:08.919
Han Moo Gang!

560
00:40:09.718 --> 00:40:12.229
What? What?

561
00:40:12.229 --> 00:40:15.329
How dare you talk to me that way? Have you gone mad? Hey!

562
00:40:16.629 --> 00:40:18.599
Get over here right now.

563
00:40:19.298 --> 00:40:21.499
- I'm busy. - You're not busy.

564
00:40:21.499 --> 00:40:22.899
If you don't get over here right now,

565
00:40:22.899 --> 00:40:25.408
you'll never be able to work as a detective again.

566
00:40:25.838 --> 00:40:27.079
- This punk. - Who is it?

567
00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:28.278
It's Moo Gang.

568
00:40:28.278 --> 00:40:30.408
How dare he talk to me like I'm his friend?

569
00:40:33.209 --> 00:40:35.979
This psycho completely slashed her to death.

570
00:40:37.218 --> 00:40:40.689
Why did he stab her so many times? Her intestines are falling out.

571
00:40:40.919 --> 00:40:43.559
I'm sure that psychopath didn't even think of her as a human being.

572
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:45.528
Where's the witness?

573
00:40:53.798 --> 00:40:55.399
Ms. Kim Mi Yeon?

574
00:40:58.269 --> 00:41:01.579
I heard you saw the patient stab her and run away.

575
00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:02.879
Yes.

576
00:41:03.408 --> 00:41:05.609
It was time for her to do her rounds.

577
00:41:06.209 --> 00:41:08.048
But she wasn't coming out, so I went inside her office.

578
00:41:09.218 --> 00:41:11.548
Are you saying he just ran away without harming you...

579
00:41:11.789 --> 00:41:14.019
even when he knew that you had witnessed the murder?

580
00:41:16.459 --> 00:41:20.859
My goodness. Hello, Detective So.

581
00:41:21.158 --> 00:41:23.298
I don't know you. Hello, Detective Kang.

582
00:41:23.298 --> 00:41:26.368
Good work. We'll take it from here.

583
00:41:26.368 --> 00:41:28.099
You guys can go now. You must be busy.

584
00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:31.939
And tell the chief that I respect him a lot.

585
00:41:31.939 --> 00:41:33.609
Are you sure you can do this?

586
00:41:33.609 --> 00:41:35.109
Of course. You can go now.

587
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:36.479
He said he's going to trust you with this.

588
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:39.508
Okay, trust me. You can go now. Go on.

589
00:41:39.979 --> 00:41:41.048
Hey.

590
00:41:42.218 --> 00:41:44.419
What happened? Did you find anything out?

591
00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:49.359
We're looking for him with the help of a nearby precinct station.

592
00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.859
It's a rural area, so he couldn't have gone too far away.

593
00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:53.428
- I'm sure we'll catch him soon. - Okay.

594
00:41:53.729 --> 00:41:54.959
What about his identity?

595
00:41:55.629 --> 00:41:58.829
His real name isn't Kang Bong Gyu, and all the documents are fake.

596
00:41:58.829 --> 00:42:01.738
We're checking for both his fingerprints and DNA...

597
00:42:01.738 --> 00:42:04.138
from the hospital room he was staying at.

598
00:42:04.769 --> 00:42:06.539
So we'll be able to find out his identity soon.

599
00:42:06.539 --> 00:42:08.579
You know this is a great opportunity for us, right?

600
00:42:08.709 --> 00:42:11.408
Let's do this well and recover our reputation.

601
00:42:11.778 --> 00:42:13.508
Yes, sir.

602
00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:15.818
- My gosh. - Hey, Chief Bong.

603
00:42:15.818 --> 00:42:17.318
- Hey. - What do you have?

604
00:42:17.318 --> 00:42:18.849
- Here. - What is it?

605
00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:22.318
This was stuck in between his toilet seat.

606
00:42:23.088 --> 00:42:26.028
I think he was trying to burn it and flush it down the toilet.

607
00:42:26.028 --> 00:42:27.928
What? Who is he?

608
00:42:28.528 --> 00:42:30.028
Do you think it's his son?

609
00:42:30.198 --> 00:42:31.798
I don't know.

610
00:42:32.229 --> 00:42:34.769
Hey, So Tae. Go to the office, and check if there are any...

611
00:42:35.198 --> 00:42:38.338
fingerprints or DNA on this photo. And look into who this could be.

612
00:42:38.338 --> 00:42:39.439
Okay.

613
00:42:39.439 --> 00:42:41.278
My gosh.

614
00:42:42.138 --> 00:42:45.879
I have to go to the bathroom again. I'll leave after I take a leak.

615
00:42:45.879 --> 00:42:49.178
Just wear diapers, you punk! How can he call himself a detective?

616
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:50.588
Can this guy...

617
00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:53.588
stop Moo Gang from working as a detective?

618
00:42:53.588 --> 00:42:55.588
Have you lost your mind?

619
00:42:56.088 --> 00:42:58.329
Don't you know how hot-tempered he is?

620
00:42:58.689 --> 00:43:00.499
You'll not only lose your job.

621
00:43:01.399 --> 00:43:02.999
If Crazy Dog decides to hunt you down,

622
00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:04.829
you'll end up losing your life.

623
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:05.999
Really?

624
00:43:06.629 --> 00:43:09.638
I can't lose my job. It'll ruin my plan.

625
00:43:11.068 --> 00:43:12.738
- Where's this punk? - "Punk"?

626
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:16.709
He's at Hope Mental Hospital in Bookyangju.

627
00:43:17.149 --> 00:43:18.349
"Hope Mental Hospital"?

628
00:43:21.519 --> 00:43:22.979
Gosh, I got it on my hands again.

629
00:43:29.919 --> 00:43:33.459
Hey, why are you coming out of there again?

630
00:43:33.459 --> 00:43:35.198
And why are you dressed like that?

631
00:43:37.468 --> 00:43:40.999
You're not even wearing underwear. What a pervert.

632
00:43:41.999 --> 00:43:43.939
(Evidence)

633
00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:50.579
Hey, take your time coming out of here.

634
00:43:58.548 --> 00:44:01.189
It's not easy to aim.

635
00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:07.298
Hey.

636
00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:10.968
I know. Calm down.

637
00:44:10.968 --> 00:44:13.129
I'm not a pervert. I'm a detective.

638
00:44:18.408 --> 00:44:19.408
I'm Detective Han.

639
00:44:19.408 --> 00:44:21.338
But why aren't you wearing any pants?

640
00:44:24.448 --> 00:44:27.008
Don't mind me.

641
00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:31.118
Anyway, do you know where...

642
00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:32.588
Crazy Dog is?

643
00:44:32.588 --> 00:44:34.289
- "Crazy Dog"? - Yes.

644
00:44:34.388 --> 00:44:35.919
Oh, are you talking about that detective?

645
00:44:36.118 --> 00:44:37.988
Everyone's at the director's office.

646
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:40.959
Sir, wait.

647
00:44:42.499 --> 00:44:44.899
I forgot to tell anyone this earlier because things were so hectic.

648
00:44:45.399 --> 00:44:46.798
But about that patient who was in room number seven...

649
00:44:47.039 --> 00:44:49.169
He had a hook-shaped scar on his face.

650
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.109
He also had a burn scar on his hand.

651
00:44:59.778 --> 00:45:02.649
Emergency! Emergency!

652
00:45:02.979 --> 00:45:05.019
Emergency! Emergency!

653
00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:07.158
Moo Gang's here! Hide the corpse!

654
00:45:07.158 --> 00:45:08.519
Hurry up! Cover it up!

655
00:45:08.519 --> 00:45:09.658
He can't be here already.

656
00:45:09.658 --> 00:45:11.689
- Hurry up. - Cover it up.

657
00:45:11.689 --> 00:45:13.488
- Do that later. - Be quiet.

658
00:45:13.488 --> 00:45:14.729
Detective Han!

659
00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:29.979
Stop shaking your hands.

660
00:45:29.979 --> 00:45:31.349
Hold it properly.

661
00:45:36.048 --> 00:45:37.289
Crazy Dog.

662
00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:42.158
Crazy Dog!

663
00:45:43.258 --> 00:45:47.658
My gosh, what's this punk's problem today?

664
00:45:50.368 --> 00:45:51.829
What do you want?

665
00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:53.629
Was it you?

666
00:45:53.669 --> 00:45:54.669
What?

667
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:56.698
Why did you ask me to come? You told me to come right away.

668
00:45:57.468 --> 00:46:00.709
How dare you talk to me as if I'm your friend?

669
00:46:01.039 --> 00:46:02.539
Have you gone mad?

670
00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:11.689
Did you want me here so you could ask me that question?

671
00:46:12.749 --> 00:46:14.019
Moo Gang!

672
00:46:15.718 --> 00:46:17.158
Anyway, I got here.

673
00:46:17.158 --> 00:46:18.789
So you better not fire me.

674
00:46:18.789 --> 00:46:21.499
- What? - I need this job for a while.

675
00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:23.459
So don't fire me until I'm done getting what I need.

676
00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:27.068
Hey, Moo Gang. Are you okay?

677
00:46:27.068 --> 00:46:29.399
Do you feel okay even after looking at this...

678
00:46:29.399 --> 00:46:30.838
corpse that's covered in blood?

679
00:46:30.838 --> 00:46:32.368
Look at the corpse.

680
00:46:32.368 --> 00:46:34.008
It's okay.

681
00:46:41.849 --> 00:46:43.548
He must've been full of resentment.

682
00:46:45.118 --> 00:46:47.919
How foolish of him. Humans don't get to live for that long anyway.

683
00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:50.258
What a load of nonsense.

684
00:46:50.859 --> 00:46:53.428
He was just a psycho who stabbed her anywhere he could.

685
00:46:53.698 --> 00:46:55.329
You're wrong, you stupid fool.

686
00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:56.899
What did you just say?

687
00:46:56.899 --> 00:46:58.599
He didn't just stab her anywhere.

688
00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:01.468
He purposely stabbed her...

689
00:47:01.468 --> 00:47:04.238
only in places that cause the most severe pain.

690
00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:06.109
He stabbed and twisted the knife.

691
00:47:07.678 --> 00:47:10.338
He watched her die a very painful death.

692
00:47:12.508 --> 00:47:14.649
Detective Han must be really ill.

693
00:47:14.649 --> 00:47:15.778
Wait a second.

694
00:47:20.419 --> 00:47:21.618
My gosh, give me that.

695
00:47:22.088 --> 00:47:23.218
Look at this.

696
00:47:23.988 --> 00:47:27.298
He stabbed her and twisted the knife in a 90 degree angle.

697
00:47:28.198 --> 00:47:30.329
She must've died very painfully.

698
00:47:34.238 --> 00:47:36.238
People who murder people like this are normally...

699
00:47:36.238 --> 00:47:38.008
gang members or a hired assassin.

700
00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:40.579
That makes sense.

701
00:47:41.338 --> 00:47:42.809
He has a point.

702
00:47:42.809 --> 00:47:45.048
Of course, we'll only be sure after we do an autopsy on her.

703
00:47:45.778 --> 00:47:48.079
Oh, is that so?

704
00:47:48.178 --> 00:47:51.519
How do you know about all this, Detective Han?

705
00:47:51.588 --> 00:47:53.618
I know just by looking at it.

706
00:47:54.419 --> 00:47:56.318
I've been doing this for years now.

707
00:47:56.419 --> 00:47:58.559
He must've gone completely insane...

708
00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.459
after having been shot in the head.

709
00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:02.028
Who ordered food?

710
00:48:02.758 --> 00:48:03.798
What?

711
00:48:04.499 --> 00:48:07.568
What kind of crazy jerk ordered food at a crime site?

712
00:48:07.568 --> 00:48:08.669
Me.

713
00:48:12.468 --> 00:48:13.908
Yes, this is it.

714
00:48:17.278 --> 00:48:18.979
This must be the liver.

715
00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:24.048
Moo Gang couldn't eat stuff like that before.

716
00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:38.399
What's this? I got something.

717
00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:44.638
Get him!

718
00:48:46.838 --> 00:48:49.539
I guess this is why everyone prefers to be in this world no matter what.

719
00:48:51.778 --> 00:48:53.408
Are you really Moo Gang?

720
00:49:02.888 --> 00:49:04.189
My gosh.

721
00:49:09.499 --> 00:49:11.298
- Hey, come on. - No way.

722
00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:13.028
Hey, don't tell me...

723
00:49:13.028 --> 00:49:14.599
Moo Gang.

724
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.030
Hey, get off the car.

725
00:49:33.729 --> 00:49:34.930
My gosh.

726
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.330
- Get off. - You crazy jerk.

727
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.140
- My gosh. - Hey, listen to me.

728
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.700
- I need to go somewhere. - Hey.

729
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.799
- That's my gun. - No.

730
00:49:43.799 --> 00:49:45.069
No, you can't have it.

731
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:46.640
- Give me back my gun! - My gosh.

732
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.939
- Stay still. - My gosh, just go inside.

733
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:03.120
He can't recognize both me and Soo Wan.

734
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.490
I don't think he remembers anything.

735
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.160
His colleagues told me that he does things that...

736
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.930
he normally wouldn't have done in the past.

737
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:15.169
It could be a temporary memory loss due to shock.

738
00:50:15.169 --> 00:50:16.540
So let's give him some time.

739
00:50:27.519 --> 00:50:29.519
How could you do this to me?

740
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:32.089
How?

741
00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:34.819
I'm sorry, Moo Gang.

742
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.390
I know I should've told you everything from the beginning.

743
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:39.790
But I was scared that you might end up leaving me.

744
00:50:41.359 --> 00:50:42.459
Yes.

745
00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:44.930
Maybe it's for the best.

746
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.240
His memory might not even come back at all.

747
00:50:49.399 --> 00:50:51.109
Then Moo Gang and I...

748
00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.180
will be able to go back to how we used to be.

749
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:14.030
Joon, I'm...

750
00:51:14.959 --> 00:51:16.229
I'm... I'm Ha Ram.

751
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:18.169
Do you remember the outcast at Moojin Elementary School?

752
00:51:18.169 --> 00:51:19.229
The shaman kid with sunglasses.

753
00:51:19.229 --> 00:51:20.499
Get lost.

754
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.479
My gosh. First love, my foot.

755
00:51:35.249 --> 00:51:36.549
Everything's useless.

756
00:51:38.919 --> 00:51:40.220
(Royeol Insurance)

757
00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:46.129
Look at this. "President Oh Man Soo".

758
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.799
(Sang Min: I told you so.)

759
00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:56.370
(Rumor says that Royeol Insurance might get sold due to bankruptcy.)

760
00:52:04.149 --> 00:52:06.580
Give me last year and this year's...

761
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.919
business reports and financial statements.

762
00:52:09.319 --> 00:52:12.819
I also want all the documents regarding the insurance settlements.

763
00:52:15.459 --> 00:52:17.959
I'm not sure if I should be saying this to you,

764
00:52:19.729 --> 00:52:21.030
but there really is no hope.

765
00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.499
It's worse than I had expected.

766
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.600
Yes.

767
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:36.580
Hello, ma'am.

768
00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.479
I just wired you the deposit money,

769
00:52:38.479 --> 00:52:39.709
so give it a check.

770
00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.850
What? What do you mean?

771
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:44.749
Your dad just came earlier...

772
00:52:44.749 --> 00:52:45.950
and told me that you're going to move out.

773
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.990
What? I don't have a dad.

774
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.629
My gosh, this jerk.

775
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.629
Open the door. I know you're inside.

776
00:52:58.629 --> 00:53:01.100
Give me back my money! My gosh!

777
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.399
Give me back my deposit money!

778
00:53:03.939 --> 00:53:05.269
Give it back!

779
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.939
Dad's not here.

780
00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:47.620
My gosh.

781
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:50.819
There it is. I found it.

782
00:54:07.269 --> 00:54:08.339
What?

783
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.839
What is this?

784
00:54:11.169 --> 00:54:13.040
Oh, that's Mom's.

785
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.410
She looks at it from time to time,

786
00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.580
but she cries every time she sees it.

787
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:23.780
She cries?

788
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.120
This is Dad's.

789
00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:35.660
(Moojin Regional Police Agency, Kang Soo Hyuk)

790
00:55:02.819 --> 00:55:06.160
"I don't think your husband's death was caused by loss of footing."

791
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.330
"I'd like to meet with you in secret."

792
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.970
Dad!

793
00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:14.899
Dad.

794
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:17.209
That shadow.

795
00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:27.479
It's okay.

796
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:29.350
Ha Ram.

797
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.189
Can you try to foresee...

798
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:33.649
how Dad will die?

799
00:55:48.569 --> 00:55:50.240
Someone will push you.

800
00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:53.010
A spider is drawn on his hand.

801
00:55:53.169 --> 00:55:54.339
Spider?

802
00:55:57.879 --> 00:55:58.879
Okay.

803
00:55:59.209 --> 00:56:02.419
I'll catch that scoundrel before he can do anything, so don't worry.

804
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.390
I'll be back soon, okay?

805
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:07.589
No! Dad, don't go.

806
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:09.120
It's okay. Dad won't die.

807
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:11.089
I'll catch that bad guy and come home very soon.

808
00:56:11.629 --> 00:56:13.629
No! Dad, no!

809
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.760
No! Don't go!

810
00:56:20.229 --> 00:56:22.200
No, Dad!

811
00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:28.109
The number you've dialed is not in service.

812
00:56:34.649 --> 00:56:35.749
How may I help you?

813
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.019
Chunsu Insurance, please.

814
00:56:40.519 --> 00:56:43.019
No phone number is found for Chunsu Insurance.

815
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.830
What? It doesn't exist anymore?

816
00:56:49.399 --> 00:56:51.700
Hey, where's that woman?

817
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.339
Can you not call Mom like that? That's so rude.

818
00:56:54.339 --> 00:56:55.769
I asked you where that woman is now!

819
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.310
She's obviously working at the hospital now.

820
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:04.879
Dad!

821
00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.720
- Dad! - My gosh.

822
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.089
Go stay with your mom, okay?

823
00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:17.830
- Dad... - I'll take you to your mom.

824
00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:23.299
That man killed my dad. That man over there.

825
00:57:24.629 --> 00:57:25.669
Who?

826
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:27.399
He has a spider drawn on his hand.

827
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.899
Where did he go?

828
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:42.780
What is this?

829
00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:44.919
Answer me.

830
00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.919
Don't cause a scene here. Let's talk outside.

831
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:52.089
Come out.

832
00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.740
This person said it wasn't an accident, right? Someone killed Dad.

833
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.339
Who did it? Does he know who the killer is?

834
00:58:03.439 --> 00:58:05.269
Why didn't you report this to the police right away?

835
00:58:05.269 --> 00:58:06.569
I didn't meet that person.

836
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:08.640
What? What did you just say?

837
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:10.379
Are you deaf or what?

838
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:12.149
I never called.

839
00:58:15.379 --> 00:58:16.479
Well...

840
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:19.749
You didn't call that person after reading this?

841
00:58:21.459 --> 00:58:24.089
Why? Why didn't you call?

842
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.160
Why didn't you meet that person?

843
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.930
Your dad's death was an accident.

844
00:58:28.959 --> 00:58:31.069
Why do I have to listen to such nonsense?

845
00:58:31.169 --> 00:58:34.970
I mean, what will it change? Will it bring your dad back to life?

846
00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.740
Well...

847
00:58:44.649 --> 00:58:46.950
You read this, didn't you?

848
00:58:47.319 --> 00:58:48.519
How could you do that?

849
00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.589
You should've at least met him and heard what he had to say.

850
00:58:52.019 --> 00:58:53.220
How...

851
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.089
How could you not meet someone who wants to tell you how Dad died?

852
00:58:57.089 --> 00:58:58.990
How could you not even meet him?

853
00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.729
I told you that I saw it.

854
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.669
I clearly told you. I saw what happened with my own two eyes.

855
00:59:10.709 --> 00:59:13.069
I saw a man pushing Dad and killing him.

856
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:16.609
Why don't you believe me when I'm telling you that I saw it?

857
00:59:16.709 --> 00:59:19.209
Why is it that no one believes me?

858
00:59:19.209 --> 00:59:20.280
You wench.

859
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:22.620
Listen.

860
00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.049
I told you to keep your lips sealed.

861
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:27.959
I said you should pretend you can't foresee anything!

862
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:29.859
Who do you think you are?

863
00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:32.490
Why do I have to listen to you?

864
00:59:35.959 --> 00:59:37.100
You...

865
00:59:37.769 --> 00:59:40.229
left me and Dad,

866
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:43.269
and you even turned a blind eye to Dad's wrongful death.

867
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:46.569
Had you...

868
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:48.709
met this person back then,

869
00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.510
had you listened to this person and reported it to the police,

870
00:59:53.749 --> 00:59:55.149
that murderer who killed Dad...

871
00:59:55.819 --> 00:59:57.290
would've been caught.

872
00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.959
You're not any better than the murderer who took Dad's life!

873
01:00:01.959 --> 01:00:03.189
Back then,

874
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.189
whether your dad lost his footing and fell to death...

875
01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:08.830
or was murdered,

876
01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:10.700
it didn't matter to me.

877
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.629
I didn't want to care!

878
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.740
But still,

879
01:00:19.339 --> 01:00:21.310
he was your husband.

880
01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.049
What did he do so wrong?

881
01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.089
What did we do so wrong to you?

882
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.019
What was wrong?

883
01:00:37.189 --> 01:00:39.030
Everything was wrong from the get-go.

884
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:42.999
Every single thing was wrong. That day at that place,

885
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.769
Kang Soo Hyuk had to die.

886
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:52.109
What?

887
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:53.510
That's right.

888
01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:56.839
Everything was wrong.

889
01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.910
Every single thing that happened,

890
01:00:59.609 --> 01:01:01.379
including falling in love with him...

891
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.490
and giving birth to you.

892
01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:14.760
What?

893
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.799
- No, we can't. We can't do that. - But...

894
01:01:51.799 --> 01:01:54.240
The police can look up information on people though.

895
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.839
I just need the address.

896
01:01:55.839 --> 01:01:59.339
We can't look up information on people just because you want us to.

897
01:01:59.339 --> 01:02:00.410
Please leave now.

898
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:03.680
Wait, Officer. Officer!

899
01:02:07.979 --> 01:02:09.649
How heartless.

900
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.799
That's right. Joon is a detective.

901
01:02:25.799 --> 01:02:28.169
He checked out? Already?

902
01:02:28.169 --> 01:02:29.269
Yes.

903
01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:32.310
But...

904
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:44.189
The customer you're calling is unavailable at the moment.

905
01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:46.490
Excuse me.

906
01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.819
Would I be able to get Detective Han's address from you?

907
01:02:49.819 --> 01:02:52.160
We cannot give out our patients' personal information.

908
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:53.790
I see.

909
01:02:55.999 --> 01:02:57.970
Gosh. What should I do, then?

910
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:01.240
Oh, right.

911
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:03.700
Would he still live at the same place?

912
01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:06.839
Where was it? Right, the letter.

913
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:09.040
It's at home. I need that letter.

914
01:03:18.149 --> 01:03:19.290
Well...

915
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:21.689
Moo Gang.

916
01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.959
You really should stay with me at my place today.

917
01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:25.160
For the next few days, I'll...

918
01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:26.689
Gosh, wait.

919
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.899
All right. Just a second.

920
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:39.240
This is the passcode for the door.

921
01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:51.049
Please don't worry too much.

922
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.490
Doctor Hwang said that it'll only be temporary.

923
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.189
Yes, I'm sure it is.

924
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:18.910
How tacky.

925
01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:29.390
Gosh.

926
01:04:29.859 --> 01:04:31.260
Darn it.

927
01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:35.399
Let's see.

928
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:41.839
(To: Joon)

929
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.040
Right, Myeonhee-dong.

930
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.580
I hope he still lives there.

931
01:05:12.569 --> 01:05:13.700
Who are you?

932
01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:15.370
You hid it here.

933
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.499
It took me so long to find this.

934
01:05:16.499 --> 01:05:19.269
- You can't take it. Give it back. - Let me borrow it, will you?

935
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:20.510
Give me back my money.

936
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:22.510
You can charge me hefty interest.

937
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.350
Give it back. And I want my rent deposit back too.

938
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.379
I'll be kicked out of this place without that money.

939
01:05:27.379 --> 01:05:28.379
Your rent deposit?

940
01:05:28.379 --> 01:05:30.419
I know that you created a bank account using my name.

941
01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:32.620
Oh, that.

942
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.160
That was transferred to a loan shark's account a long time ago.

943
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.890
That's all I had.

944
01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:41.530
Do you know what I went through to save that money?

945
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:44.030
Don't you worry.

946
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.530
I'll hit the jackpot with this money...

947
01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:48.669
and pay you back right away with interest.

948
01:05:51.769 --> 01:05:55.140
By the way, all you do is hide in the house like a pathetic loner.

949
01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:57.109
How did you manage to save up this much?

950
01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.379
Do you earn money from giving people fortune-telling readings?

951
01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:05.120
Yes, that's how I made all that money.

952
01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.089
You know how good I am, right?

953
01:06:08.459 --> 01:06:10.189
I do, you wench.

954
01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:12.229
You're cursed.

955
01:06:12.859 --> 01:06:15.530
That's why your dad died.

956
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.130
That's right.

957
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.269
My dad died because of me.

958
01:06:21.569 --> 01:06:23.370
Shall I kill you too?

959
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.240
What? What did you just say?

960
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.139
Are you deaf?

961
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.979
I'll give you a reading since I'm not wearing my sunglasses.

962
01:06:29.979 --> 01:06:32.880
Goodness, you stupid wench.

963
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:35.620
I raised you for years.

964
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.889
You should be thanking me. How can you talk like that to your stepdad?

965
01:06:39.889 --> 01:06:40.960
Wait!

966
01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:45.160
If you take that money,

967
01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.229
you'll die before you can even take 10 steps.

968
01:06:48.899 --> 01:06:50.670
And you won't just die.

969
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:51.729
What?

970
01:06:52.569 --> 01:06:54.269
That crazy wench.

971
01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:02.509
This is insane! I shouldn't have seen it!

972
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:06.050
How can someone die like that?

973
01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:07.819
My gosh!

974
01:07:07.819 --> 01:07:09.679
You crazy wench.

975
01:07:09.679 --> 01:07:11.790
Don't put on a show!

976
01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:15.319
How can someone die like that?

977
01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:18.330
Go away! Go! Get out of my face!

978
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:20.759
I don't care. If I don't take this money,

979
01:07:21.099 --> 01:07:23.759
those jerks will kill me anyway.

980
01:07:25.229 --> 01:07:27.099
Wait, no!

981
01:07:27.399 --> 01:07:30.269
No, no. You can't leave.

982
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:32.340
Let go, you wench!

983
01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.620
Joon.

984
01:08:24.559 --> 01:08:26.389
Joon.

985
01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.099
Joon.

986
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:32.700
Joon.

987
01:09:02.599 --> 01:09:03.700
Ha Ram.

988
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:06.929
You shouldn't fall asleep here.

989
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.540
You'll catch a cold. Wake up already.

990
01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:17.710
Joon.

991
01:09:18.809 --> 01:09:20.280
Is it you, Joon?

992
01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:28.719
Joon.

993
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:32.889
Joon.

994
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.059
Why did you never write me back?

995
01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:46.009
I waited for your letter every day.

996
01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.580
Joon.

997
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.059
Why did you pretend not to know me?

998
01:10:03.719 --> 01:10:04.830
Why?

999
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.540
Joon.

1000
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:26.109
No, no, no! No...

1001
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:34.759
Joon.

1002
01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:04.920
Who are you?

1003
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:20.030
Joon.

1004
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.309
Are you dead?

1005
01:11:29.809 --> 01:11:31.149
Joon...

1006
01:11:34.219 --> 01:11:35.580
Goodness.

1007
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.950
Is there a big hole in the sky or what?

1008
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:39.050
Why is it pouring so hard?

1009
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.290
What happened? You haven't found him yet?

1010
01:11:42.359 --> 01:11:45.059
I think he already got out of the area.

1011
01:11:45.059 --> 01:11:46.290
Darn it.

1012
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.300
Have you managed to identify him?

1013
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.599
Well, that's...

1014
01:11:49.599 --> 01:11:52.530
About the murder suspect of the mental hospital case...

1015
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.469
I heard all the records have been deleted.

1016
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:55.870
What?

1017
01:11:56.439 --> 01:11:58.469
All the records are gone.

1018
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.080
I'm calling about the murder suspect of the Hope Mental Hospital case.

1019
01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.550
Have you guys found any fingerprints or DNA?

1020
01:12:09.519 --> 01:12:10.719
All right.

1021
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.620
- Nothing has been found. - Goodness.

1022
01:12:16.019 --> 01:12:17.330
They've found nothing?

1023
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:19.189
How is that possible?

1024
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:21.200
He ate and slept in that room.

1025
01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.069
That jerk must've deleted all hospital records...

1026
01:12:24.069 --> 01:12:26.429
as well as his traces and DNA before he fled.

1027
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:27.469
Seriously?

1028
01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:30.240
Don't think of him as just a crazy guy.

1029
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:32.439
The murder was meticulously premeditated.

1030
01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:35.309
I bet he had an elaborate plan to make sure he can kill the director.

1031
01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.040
What is it, then?

1032
01:12:37.179 --> 01:12:39.109
That means Moo Gang was right.

1033
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:45.149
He didn't just stab her anywhere.

1034
01:12:46.519 --> 01:12:47.889
He purposely stabbed her...

1035
01:12:47.889 --> 01:12:50.729
only in places that cause the most severe pain.

1036
01:12:50.729 --> 01:12:52.559
He stabbed and twisted the knife.

1037
01:12:52.889 --> 01:12:55.429
He watched her die a very painful death.

1038
01:12:56.359 --> 01:12:58.530
Gosh, what happened to Moo Gang?

1039
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.899
He's acting like a totally different person.

1040
01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.080
I asked you who you are.

1041
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.160
He must be fated to live such a long life.

1042
01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:28.160
I should've pulled his eyes out back then.

1043
01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.750
This man will die!

1044
01:13:45.109 --> 01:13:49.349
If you don't come out, this jerk will really die.

1045
01:13:49.519 --> 01:13:52.349
What? What? What are you looking at?

1046
01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:54.120
Stop hiding already.

1047
01:13:55.219 --> 01:13:57.059
I'll really kill this guy!

1048
01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:00.259
Don't come near me. Stay away.

1049
01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:02.399
Or I'm really going to kill him.

1050
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.630
I said, I'm really going to kill him!

1051
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.670
This is a real gun.

1052
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.109
Shoot him.

1053
01:14:42.439 --> 01:14:45.009
We'll get punished for being an accomplice.

1054
01:14:45.009 --> 01:14:47.710
I can't watch you get harmed.

1055
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:51.410
I'm going to catch you with my own two hands.

1056
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:06.630
You may not remember this.

1057
01:15:06.759 --> 01:15:08.630
Clear! Shoot!

1058
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.639
You died back then, Moo Gang.

1059
01:15:18.269 --> 01:15:19.439
What?

1060
01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:30.990
Who are you?

1061
01:15:36.219 --> 01:15:37.389
Me?

1062
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:06.290
(Black)

1063
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:08.059
He might act weird,

1064
01:16:08.059 --> 01:16:10.559
but let's just think of it as a mental illness.

1065
01:16:11.559 --> 01:16:12.630
Moo Gang! No!

1066
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.759
I can't take your soul to the afterlife yet.

1067
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:18.300
Just wait a little more.

1068
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.700
He would've come after me if I had told him.

1069
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.040
Remember that woman who you said was going to die? She got murdered.

1070
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.309
Did that guy almost die a couple days ago?

1071
01:16:26.309 --> 01:16:28.280
There's a shadow inside his body.

1072
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.910
Did you think I'd never be able to find you?
