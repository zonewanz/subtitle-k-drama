1
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.419
Is something wrong?

2
00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:55.930
(You only love one. Bok Nam.)

3
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.830
Are you going to work tomorrow?

4
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.470
Pardon?

5
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.669
Of course. I should go work.

6
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.669
I'm new, so I should go early.

7
00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.540
What happens if you don't go?

8
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:13.080
If I don't go? I'd probably get fired.

9
00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:15.379
Why do you ask?

10
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.250
Would you be able to take Kitty...

11
00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.659
to the vet tomorrow?

12
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:27.530
Tomorrow?

13
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.629
- Okay. I'll go early afternoon. - No.

14
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.230
In the morning.

15
00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.000
I would appreciate it if you go in the morning.

16
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.940
Okay. I'll do that.

17
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459
He didn't want me to when I offered.

18
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.759
What is it now?

19
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.269
How can a liberal arts major like myself understand...

20
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.269
the workings of a natural sciences' brain?

21
00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.840
Can you switch shifts with me tomorrow?

22
00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.520
"You only love one."

23
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.319
It doesn't make any sense.

24
00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.430
He must have been a bad student.

25
00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.460
Is he copying a drama?

26
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.599
Hello, Bo Mi.

27
00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:47.539
I'm sorry to call you so late.

28
00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.740
Out of the complaints list, there's Yeon Bok Nam.

29
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.150
The complaint was stalking.

30
00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.889
When and where did the complaint come from?

31
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.090
I sent you the vet's address through a text.

32
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.690
It's Kitty's regular vet,

33
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.199
so she'll be used to it.

34
00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.699
Okay.

35
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.729
I should be done by lunch, right?

36
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.639
- I'll tell you what happened after. - No.

37
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.740
Depending on her condition, there could be additional tests.

38
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.310
Please take care of her.

39
00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.250
Please pay for the bill and transportation with this.

40
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.849
You should take a taxi.

41
00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.349
It's okay. There is a bus that goes straight there.

42
00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.490
No...

43
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.289
It's not okay for Kitty.

44
00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.329
She's never been anywhere that's crowded.

45
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.500
How many tests do you think she'll need?

46
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.569
I heard that some vets force you to do more things...

47
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.639
to make you pay more.

48
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.909
Please let her do it all.

49
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.109
Whatever the vet asks.

50
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.449
You can pay all at once.

51
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
Okay.

52
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.629
Take care of yourself today.

53
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.870
I'll be going then.

54
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.620
No, but I don't want to do something wrong now.

55
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:46.389
If we spend more time together, I might sleep with you.

56
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.160
- What? - Oh, and...

57
00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.699
the room number wasn't 303. It was 304.

58
00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:51.959
Our room, I mean.

59
00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.190
- Good morning! - Hello.

60
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.649
- Hello! - Hello!

61
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.019
- Hello. - Wow!

62
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.269
- Mr. Ma. - Bo Mi.

63
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:11.579
Breathe in the fresh morning air!

64
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.310
It's no time to be filming "500 Days of Summer" here.

65
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.120
- Let's go to the office. - Why?

66
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.290
- Hello. - Good morning.

67
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.290
(Complaint list)

68
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:30.529
(Come to YOLO Cafe, 24. Complaint: Stalking)

69
00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.069
Have you contacted the person that reported him?

70
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.879
Yes. They were chatting through our chat room...

71
00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.410
when they exchanged numbers and got closer.

72
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.180
When she stopped calling, he started to call her like crazy.

73
00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:52.420
When she blocked him, he called her office.

74
00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:55.889
If this is true, then it's serious.

75
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.819
Some people make fake reports.

76
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.930
We should double check that this is true.

77
00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:05.000
Can we get the blacklist from the other app?

78
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.600
You can probably ask Won Seok to get it for you.

79
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.699
Okay.

80
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.839
Bo Mi, will you come with me?

81
00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:14.670
Okay.

82
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.240
He's reliable, right?

83
00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:20.480
- Pardon? - I'm talking about Se Hee.

84
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.550
He's the manly type.

85
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.149
Well...

86
00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.449
If I were to put him in a category, I wouldn't put him there.

87
00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.019
It's okay to boast in front of us.

88
00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:35.129
Everyone in this hospital knows that Se Hee is a tough guy.

89
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.730
A tough guy?

90
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.430
When he brought Kitty here for the first time,

91
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.230
he was so mad.

92
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.300
The nurses gave him that nickname. Tough Guy.

93
00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:49.209
He got mad? Se Hee?

94
00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:50.509
Didn't you know?

95
00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:54.310
Kitty was doing bad then.

96
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.019
I told him he should prepare himself for the worst,

97
00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.949
then he slammed his fist right here and got very upset.

98
00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:01.949
He told me I was irresponsible.

99
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:04.690
It didn't matter how much. He wanted me to save Kitty.

100
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.360
He wasn't even the owner then.

101
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.629
No. Someone threw her out.

102
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:12.129
She was about to die on the streets when Se Hee ran here...

103
00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:13.730
with Kitty in his arms in the middle of the night.

104
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.899
You married a good man.

105
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.740
There's no bad guy that likes animals.

106
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.370
- Right? - Sure.

107
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.240
The problem is that you only care about animals.

108
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.980
You shouldn't believe things they say before marriage,

109
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:29.250
right?

110
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.589
I didn't know you two were married.

111
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.540
Welcome.

112
00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:56.069
It's not lunchtime yet. You're early.

113
00:08:56.069 --> 00:08:57.640
Yes. I came to get snacks.

114
00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.079
We have a new menu today.

115
00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:00.709
- You should taste it. - Okay.

116
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.459
Hello.

117
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.690
Ji Ho said that she'll be late today.

118
00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:15.430
Yes, I know.

119
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.329
Try some of this.

120
00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:24.599
Wow. Pack me five of these.

121
00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:26.599
Okay.

122
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.940
You must be low on sugar this morning.

123
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.180
Is your boss slaving you?

124
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.810
He's always slaving me.

125
00:09:35.849 --> 00:09:37.520
Your bag must be heavy.

126
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.650
You have a lot of tools.

127
00:09:40.849 --> 00:09:43.119
It's essential for those riding motorcycles.

128
00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:44.489
You need it when you work.

129
00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:47.760
What kind of work?

130
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.900
I fix the motorcycle...

131
00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:52.999
and women's hearts.

132
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.569
You can pay here.

133
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.310
It's 26 dollars.

134
00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:06.940
Signature, please.

135
00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:10.780
Your signature changed.

136
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.119
It's my first time signing.

137
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.319
I paid with cash last time.

138
00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:19.690
Really?

139
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.459
I must have confused you with someone else.

140
00:10:26.229 --> 00:10:27.599
Do you want to try that too?

141
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.069
Tough Guy?

142
00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:38.910
He ran with Kitty?

143
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.650
My landlord?

144
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.849
The neocortex?

145
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.449
No way. Come on.

146
00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:50.249
- What's this? - Ji Ho.

147
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.459
What is this? Didn't you go to work?

148
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.660
I had an errand to run. I'm going to work now.

149
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:56.560
What about you? Where are you going?

150
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.060
Where do you think? To your cafe!

151
00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:02.729
Ta-da. Bok Nam gave us so many coupons. We should use it.

152
00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:06.040
Aren't you busy? What about work?

153
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.209
I have an offsite meeting today,

154
00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.770
so I'm free until the afternoon.

155
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.979
I'm off today.

156
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.440
Let's go in.

157
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.910
Maybe it's a fake report.

158
00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:18.020
He looks too nice.

159
00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:21.249
You look pretty ordinary from afar as well.

160
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:31.660
I checked how much that thing is, and it's really expensive.

161
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.430
Are you curious?

162
00:11:34.099 --> 00:11:35.599
No, not really.

163
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.440
Why would I be curious about that?

164
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.170
Right. You wouldn't be interested in such a thing.

165
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.839
Well, if you researched it, I'll let you tell me.

166
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.410
How much is it?

167
00:11:48.979 --> 00:11:50.249
Hey! It's Se Hee!

168
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.290
Hey, who is that woman beside him?

169
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.430
You're right. Who is she?

170
00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.499
That's an excellent motorcycle.

171
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:08.030
I've only seen it displayed. Someone actually rides it?

172
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:09.770
That's Bok Nam's.

173
00:12:10.199 --> 00:12:12.940
Really? That's Bok Nam's?

174
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.140
It would cost as much as a car.

175
00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:16.910
Really?

176
00:12:19.109 --> 00:12:20.239
Isn't it crazy?

177
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.119
No. It's not as much as I anticipated.

178
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.420
Shall we go back?

179
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.930
We were out for too long.

180
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.849
Se Hee, be careful.

181
00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:04.190
That mirror will cost you a week's worth of overtime.

182
00:13:05.619 --> 00:13:07.229
It probably costs more.

183
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.989
Be careful...

184
00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:12.800
until 2048. You might have to pay for it along with your mortgage.

185
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.199
You're exaggerating.

186
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.640
How can you compare a house and a mirror?

187
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.109
How much would such a small mirror cost?

188
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.979
No, my motorcycle!

189
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.339
Se Hee.

190
00:13:58.239 --> 00:14:01.209
Ji Ho. What do we do about your husband?

191
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.719
(Episode 6: Because This Is My First Husband)

192
00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:18.800
What is that? Did someone poop?

193
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.249
- Ouch. - Gosh! You surprised me.

194
00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.310
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.249
Were you sleeping there? I'm sorry.

196
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.579
- I'm sorry. - Sang Goo.

197
00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:40.180
Hey, Won Seok.

198
00:14:40.249 --> 00:14:42.150
What brings you here?

199
00:14:42.249 --> 00:14:44.260
There's nowhere to sit here.

200
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.959
I should have visited earlier. I'm sorry.

201
00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:50.959
You should put this in your office.

202
00:14:51.229 --> 00:14:53.199
It's a plant that purifies the air.

203
00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:56.630
It's the best for people that never ventilate.

204
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.270
- Thank you. - Gosh.

205
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.709
Let's see...

206
00:15:01.469 --> 00:15:02.969
Byung Tae, where should I put this?

207
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.239
Byung Tae.

208
00:15:09.249 --> 00:15:11.119
Sang Hoon, where should I put this?

209
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.989
There's no space for anything other than food in here.

210
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.790
Why don't you just hold it yourself?

211
00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:18.459
I see.

212
00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:22.890
- Let's go out and talk. - Shall we?

213
00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:26.359
Sorry for bothering you.

214
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.469
- Here. - Thanks.

215
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.170
What's up with the mood in your office?

216
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.180
Sang Hoon is about to get dumped by his girlfriend.

217
00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:41.979
The scary-looking punk on the sofa back there.

218
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.949
That's why he looked so sensitive.

219
00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:47.449
Isn't it too petty for young people to be obsessed with relationships?

220
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:49.650
I mean, it's common to date someone and break up in their age.

221
00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:52.790
His girlfriend's parents told him to break up with her...

222
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.859
if he was going to continue developing the app.

223
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.160
They won't allow the marriage if he can't get a job within this year.

224
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.229
I see.

225
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.099
I'm struggling too.

226
00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:04.400
Everything's so hard.

227
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.869
My work and my love life too.

228
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.239
I'm being forced to be celibate at the moment.

229
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.380
- Ho Rang doesn't want to do it. - Do what?

230
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:16.709
What? Why?

231
00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.319
She feels unsafe to sleep with a man who has no intention of marriage.

232
00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:23.489
If I want to do it... Gosh, it's humiliating.

233
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.790
She wants me to wear two condoms.

234
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.829
It's not like socks. How could you wear two...

235
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.630
What should you do?

236
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.300
I'm seriously thinking of marrying her.

237
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.229
You must be struggling so much.

238
00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:37.569
This isn't just a simple crisis.

239
00:16:38.969 --> 00:16:42.640
My job offer is still valid, so call me if you want to join.

240
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.010
- Okay? - Thank you.

241
00:16:46.479 --> 00:16:48.410
Can you show me the picture of that guy you talked about?

242
00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.420
It's him. Can you find out...

243
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.949
if he's on blacklists of other dating applications?

244
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.420
I'll look into it.

245
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:59.260
What are you going to do by the way?

246
00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:01.390
I heard he works with Ji Ho.

247
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.390
Exactly.

248
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.800
If he was just on our blacklist, I could simply kick him out.

249
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.770
But Ji Ho is involved in this. That's what's making me worried.

250
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.600
He works with Ji Ho, so I can't act rashly.

251
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.610
It's fortunate that her husband is related.

252
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.479
He's the ace in the field too.

253
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.110
Right, we've got Se Hee.

254
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.719
He's realistic and meticulous. I bet he won't bleed even if he gets hurt.

255
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.390
I stitched it up more than I thought.

256
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.360
Don't let water near it and come again after a week.

257
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.590
Okay.

258
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.529
You said you rolled on the ground, right? How did it happen?

259
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.430
Who's his guardian?

260
00:17:46.969 --> 00:17:48.910
It's me.

261
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:53.140
- Because of a bike... - It happened while he drove a bike?

262
00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.249
Then we should do an X-ray scan on him.

263
00:17:57.779 --> 00:17:59.920
I didn't know you ride a motorbike.

264
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.489
No wonder why your eyes are sharp.

265
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.459
No.

266
00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:07.890
He didn't drive a bike.

267
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.430
- While trying to avoid it. - A running bike?

268
00:18:10.759 --> 00:18:12.459
Shouldn't we go through a CT scan on him then?

269
00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:14.830
That's...

270
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.570
It wasn't running.

271
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.239
So...

272
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.269
It happened while I tried to avoid a parked motorbike.

273
00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.080
What? I mean, why...

274
00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:27.410
Why?

275
00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:31.680
Was it because that bike was very expensive?

276
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.489
Did you do it not to make any scratches on the bike?

277
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.219
You're silly.

278
00:18:37.259 --> 00:18:39.190
It's not the case, right?

279
00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:40.890
What kind of lunatic would sacrifice their life...

280
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:44.860
not to damage it? It'd never happen even if it was extremely expensive.

281
00:18:49.769 --> 00:18:52.370
I'll see you after a week.

282
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.920
Se Hee is so athletic.

283
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:11.920
I know. How did he throw his body there?

284
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.360
He should be a professional diver.

285
00:19:16.459 --> 00:19:18.130
A diver, my foot.

286
00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:20.469
Ji Ho must be so ashamed.

287
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.999
Don't you think so?

288
00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:24.469
- Well... - It wasn't that bad.

289
00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:27.309
She must be. That rearview mirror wouldn't cost that much.

290
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.640
And he rolled on the ground to dodge it.

291
00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:31.580
His wife's friends saw everything too.

292
00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:34.549
I would've been too embarrassed if it were me.

293
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.019
Why are you in this car by the way? Shouldn't you go to your office?

294
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.289
I should.

295
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:42.749
But I couldn't get in that couple's car.

296
00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:44.920
It would've been too awkward.

297
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.930
Can you turn left and drop me off at the intersection?

298
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.759
Sure, we're going the same direction.

299
00:19:51.459 --> 00:19:52.959
No, we aren't.

300
00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:57.370
Do you know much about a man named Bok Nam?

301
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.799
We just know him.

302
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.910
Why do you ask? Are you interested in him?

303
00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:06.910
No way. She works in a dating app company,

304
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.449
so she should know better about her appearance level.

305
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.650
My level might be higher than yours.

306
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.289
You haven't done our level evaluation, have you?

307
00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:19.590
I don't need to because I have a boyfriend.

308
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.330
And I believe only those who lack self-esteem do such stuff.

309
00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:27.469
You have a boyfriend and self-esteem,

310
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:29.400
but you lack manners.

311
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.499
What?

312
00:20:33.199 --> 00:20:34.440
She's so weird.

313
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.209
Thank you.

314
00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:54.059
Does it not hurt?

315
00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.930
No, I'm fine.

316
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:03.370
Why did you do it?

317
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.170
You wouldn't have been injured...

318
00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:10.410
if you had touched that bike.

319
00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:14.350
If I had, the bike would've been broken or fallen.

320
00:21:15.479 --> 00:21:18.180
Still, it's better for the bike to be broken...

321
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.289
than a person to be injured.

322
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.019
Well, it's not a matter of right or wrong.

323
00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:27.059
In the end, my treatment fee came out much cheaper...

324
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.330
than the repair fee.

325
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:34.600
Se Hee is such a manly man.

326
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.370
He got so mad and slammed this table.

327
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.269
The nurses call him Tough Guy.

328
00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:44.709
Tough Guy, my foot.

329
00:21:47.309 --> 00:21:48.350
Pardon?

330
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.519
Nothing.

331
00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:53.479
Oh, right. They told me to come pick up the cat in the evening.

332
00:21:54.019 --> 00:21:55.949
They still have checkups to go through.

333
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.190
I see.

334
00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:59.059
Thank you.

335
00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:03.630
Shall we go?

336
00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:09.100
You're going back to the office, right?

337
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400
Yes.

338
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.239
What about you, Ji Ho?

339
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.440
You're going to that cafe?

340
00:22:14.739 --> 00:22:15.739
Yes.

341
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.610
I might really get fired if I don't show up.

342
00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:21.410
I need to go.

343
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.420
Do you have anything to say to me?

344
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.620
About that cafe...

345
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.630
Go on.

346
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.830
Until when are you planning to work at that cafe?

347
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.640
Well, I'm planning to work there for the time being...

348
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:48.070
unless I get fired.

349
00:22:49.809 --> 00:22:51.209
Why do you ask?

350
00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:52.640
Well...

351
00:22:53.209 --> 00:22:56.180
I'm wondering if it has to be that cafe.

352
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.320
There are many other cafes near our house.

353
00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:01.390
What I mean is...

354
00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.360
There are other cafes you can commute by foot.

355
00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:08.160
I don't think it's necessary to go all the way there.

356
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.900
By any chance,

357
00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:14.070
does it bother you?

358
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.070
Are you that uncomfortable to have your colleagues...

359
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.940
visit my workplace?

360
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:28.150
- No, that's... - Don't worry.

361
00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.850
Like you asked, I'm avoiding possible situations...

362
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.549
in which we have to act like a married couple.

363
00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:40.489
And I've been to all the cafes...

364
00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.890
around our house.

365
00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:44.630
I failed to get a job in those places.

366
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.769
There are not many part-time jobs which I can get...

367
00:23:48.729 --> 00:23:49.969
in my current situation.

368
00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:54.309
I was able to get a job in that cafe thanks to Bok Nam.

369
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.009
So it took me much time and effort...

370
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.039
to get that part-time work.

371
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.779
Please don't say it so easily.

372
00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:15.360
I'll see you at home.

373
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:17.160
Bye.

374
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.729
Personally? You mean how I like you?

375
00:24:53.729 --> 00:24:56.430
I always care about you, wonder what you're doing,

376
00:24:56.699 --> 00:24:59.070
and I always miss you. I just don't like it.

377
00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:01.840
I hate it when they play dirty with you.

378
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.029
She came back.

379
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:27.900
Ms. Woo, are you coming back from Techno Valley?

380
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.699
Yes. I also dropped by the headquarters of M company.

381
00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:33.070
I see.

382
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:37.610
Take care.

383
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.709
- Did you see that? - What?

384
00:25:43.309 --> 00:25:44.580
I don't think so.

385
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.150
It's not the first time I've seen it.

386
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.249
Do you want to bet?

387
00:25:53.989 --> 00:25:56.059
Have you heard about Ms. Woo?

388
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.299
What about her?

389
00:25:58.529 --> 00:26:02.299
Are you talking about the Golden Venture CEO hitting on her?

390
00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:04.570
Really? How did it happen?

391
00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:08.570
- Like this. - That's disgusting!

392
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.239
So what did Ms. Woo do?

393
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.410
I heard Ms. Woo didn't do anything.

394
00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:18.449
But Mr. Ma of Gyeol Mal Ae had a go and swore at him.

395
00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:20.449
Really? Why?

396
00:26:20.719 --> 00:26:22.620
Maybe they have something going on.

397
00:26:22.719 --> 00:26:24.959
Mr. Ma wouldn't have done that with any other reasons.

398
00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:26.920
He was one of this major investors.

399
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.130
People are talking about Ms. Woo not wearing her bra...

400
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.160
while having meetings outside the office.

401
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.969
Maybe he fell for her because of that.

402
00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:36.199
Really? Does she not wear a bra?

403
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:38.840
Is she an escort or what?

404
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.969
I didn't know she was like that.

405
00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.640
I really liked Ms. Woo.

406
00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:44.709
I'm so disappointed.

407
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.279
Why are you disappointed? Were you guys close to each other?

408
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.019
Wait for me!

409
00:27:11.699 --> 00:27:13.670
(Mr. Ma)

410
00:27:27.449 --> 00:27:28.650
Shorty?

411
00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.489
What? Who are you calling me that?

412
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.090
Mr. Ma and the short man,

413
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.360
please move a bit towards the bride.

414
00:27:39.229 --> 00:27:41.600
Do you have the document Mr. Ma asked?

415
00:27:41.699 --> 00:27:43.769
- Come with me. - Okay.

416
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.999
Where is Sang Goo?

417
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.170
He's having an urgent meeting with his VIP guest.

418
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.640
You can talk to me.

419
00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:52.680
VIP?

420
00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:57.019
Please call me after work. Let's eat dinner together.

421
00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.680
I'm at the cafe in front of your office.

422
00:28:05.704 --> 00:28:08.936
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E08 Because This is My First Life
"Because This is My First Husband"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

423
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.370
You didn't have to come here now.

424
00:28:20.469 --> 00:28:22.110
I told you I would wait until you finish work.

425
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.640
Why are you here?

426
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.509
Why am I here? You saw my message.

427
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.449
You are too stressed with your work today.

428
00:28:29.449 --> 00:28:32.350
So I came here to treat you to nice dinner, Woo Soo Ji.

429
00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.519
I have a lot of things to do today. I finish quite late tonight.

430
00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:41.529
Do you know why it is good to be a CEO?

431
00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.559
Even though I have a lot of work to do, I don't have to be...

432
00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:47.029
in the office and nobody can say anything about it.

433
00:28:47.729 --> 00:28:49.130
I'm really okay.

434
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.969
I can work here and wait.

435
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.239
I really mean it. I even brought my work here.

436
00:28:54.709 --> 00:28:57.380
Look. Here's my laptop,

437
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.650
earphones, mouse,

438
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.279
and the flower.

439
00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.890
As it's our 1st day of relationship, I bought just 1 flower.

440
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.890
You can expect more from now on.

441
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:14.959
You know, Ms. Woo...

442
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.690
That's her social life.

443
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.559
- Don't you think so? - Wait...

444
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.100
Mr. Ma, we need to talk.

445
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.529
We are talking now, aren't we?

446
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.370
Please take this.

447
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.699
Come with me.

448
00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.279
- Why are you like this? - What?

449
00:29:37.249 --> 00:29:38.350
What do you mean?

450
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:40.449
I said I want to treat you to dinner.

451
00:29:40.949 --> 00:29:42.320
What's going on?

452
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.420
Exactly. Why do you want to buy me dinner?

453
00:29:46.989 --> 00:29:49.360
You even came here without telling me anything.

454
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.600
I guess you are a bit cold when you are in a relationship.

455
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.969
I said I wanted to sleep with you. It didn't mean I wanted to date you.

456
00:30:02.209 --> 00:30:05.809
Mr. Ma, are you 20 or something?

457
00:30:07.309 --> 00:30:08.410
What?

458
00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:11.150
I think you are misunderstanding the situation.

459
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.590
I was just fooling around with you...

460
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.120
because I wanted to sleep with someone.

461
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:19.459
I thought...

462
00:30:20.729 --> 00:30:22.830
you were just like me too.

463
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.529
But you are so much more innocent than I thought. It's embarrassing.

464
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.140
Soo Ji.

465
00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:38.880
You are unbelievably evil.

466
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.920
Yes, I am horrible.

467
00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.320
That's why I can hold out this much in this field.

468
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.320
So...

469
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:53.219
stop getting in my way, Mr. Ma.

470
00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:55.930
Woo Soo Ji!

471
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.930
What did you say?

472
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.799
"Stop getting in my way"?

473
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.299
Did I suggest anything more than...

474
00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.870
having dinner together?

475
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.209
We are on the same page. We can get to know each other.

476
00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:14.749
That's all I want.

477
00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:18.779
You don't have to be this aggressive about it all.

478
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.049
Look.

479
00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.289
I think you are confused your work with some university club activity.

480
00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:27.190
Well, that doesn't matter even. If the relationship ends,

481
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:28.590
it always badly affects women.

482
00:31:29.489 --> 00:31:31.059
People will blame the woman.

483
00:31:31.459 --> 00:31:34.170
The woman will be the one leaving that community.

484
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.299
Why are you so twisted?

485
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.070
I think you don't know the world well.

486
00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:43.979
Do you think the world has changed?

487
00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.239
Everything is just the same.

488
00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:54.949
If you really want to sleep with me,

489
00:31:55.949 --> 00:31:57.289
quit your job and talk to me again.

490
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.459
I will date you then.

491
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:11.999
(YOLO Rider was reported.)

492
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.640
Was he reported here too?

493
00:32:14.709 --> 00:32:15.809
Yes, he was.

494
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.880
They exchanged their numbers and messaged each other.

495
00:32:20.239 --> 00:32:22.049
But when she blocked him, he was stalking her for ages.

496
00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:23.549
He tried to call and message her loads and hacked into her accounts.

497
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.880
We got the same report about him.

498
00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:27.719
It sounds similar to...

499
00:32:29.449 --> 00:32:31.259
the rape incident that happened in Namgang station.

500
00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:32.759
It's a similar behavior pattern.

501
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:39.259
I don't think so. He doesn't look like a criminal.

502
00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:42.900
Hello? I hear I look like a model when I'm sitting like now.

503
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.680
They met through an online game.

504
00:32:51.809 --> 00:32:54.650
He kept stalking her because he was upset that she blocked him.

505
00:32:54.749 --> 00:32:55.910
He tracked down her SNS...

506
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.320
and found out where she was with one of the hashtags.

507
00:32:59.249 --> 00:33:00.949
He's not arrested yet.

508
00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:04.989
Is he not arrested yet?

509
00:33:04.989 --> 00:33:07.259
No, that's what I heard.

510
00:33:07.459 --> 00:33:09.459
My friend is working at the game company.

511
00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:14.170
I heard Ji Ho's working with him.

512
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.930
Don't you need to tell her?

513
00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:20.769
It's difficult for me to get a part-time job at the moment.

514
00:33:20.769 --> 00:33:24.110
I could get my job at that cafe because Bok Nam helped me.

515
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:28.309
That job isn't something I got easily.

516
00:33:28.309 --> 00:33:30.180
I hope you don't talk like it's nothing.

517
00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:36.150
Even though I want to tell her, I have to confirm the facts first.

518
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.259
What if it's not true?

519
00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:40.289
It won't be pleasant for anyone.

520
00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:43.130
There's a risk that Ji Ho could lose her job.

521
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.330
This guy could lose his job too.

522
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.100
It's just a part-time job. She can quit it anytime.

523
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.769
That part-time job can be important to someone.

524
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.170
I can't be arrogant about it and ruin it for them.

525
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.940
I also don't want to take any responsibility of that.

526
00:33:58.809 --> 00:34:01.709
Would you be able to...

527
00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.249
ask your friend of that game company...

528
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.049
to find out more about Namgang Station Kidnap case?

529
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.920
I would also love to get the information of the suspect.

530
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.420
I will ask.

531
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.159
By the way, what happened to your forehead?

532
00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:23.940
There was an accident.

533
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.039
It was willful negligence.

534
00:34:39.579 --> 00:34:41.849
- Weak coffee for Ms. Oh. - Okay.

535
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.229
Here's your coffee.

536
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.400
It's your day off. Why are you by yourself today?

537
00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:56.470
Where's Won Seok? Are you not going to meet him?

538
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.070
He's busy today.

539
00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:02.010
Isn't it pretty?

540
00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:04.380
This is for you. I bought some because they were on sale.

541
00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:07.280
That's mine? For me?

542
00:35:08.209 --> 00:35:09.780
Why? Is it not pretty?

543
00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:13.849
Then how about this one?

544
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:18.360
No, that belongs to you. This one looks like Ji Ho's.

545
00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.360
Is that so?

546
00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:22.959
My gosh.

547
00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:25.329
What nonsense is he saying?

548
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:27.429
I know.

549
00:35:27.429 --> 00:35:30.940
Ji Ho must seem like an innocent type to men.

550
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.539
It's not that she seems like it. She is innocent.

551
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:35.740
White suits Ji Ho so well.

552
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.280
Especially in sleeveless shirts.

553
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.510
- Her shoulder line is pretty. - Hey.

554
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.619
What are you talking about? It's too cold for sleeveless shirts.

555
00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:45.749
I know.

556
00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.249
You talk as if you've seen her shoulder line.

557
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.889
You look better with the hair on the side.

558
00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:55.459
When have you seen me put my hair on the side?

559
00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:56.889
I've never done that in front of you.

560
00:35:58.459 --> 00:36:01.329
I mean, I think you'd look good if you do that.

561
00:36:05.269 --> 00:36:08.510
I don't have to see it in person. I can just tell because she's pretty.

562
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.610
The cake's on the house.

563
00:36:15.249 --> 00:36:17.720
Should I just live with him instead of Won Seok?

564
00:36:18.849 --> 00:36:20.389
You don't even mean that.

565
00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:23.590
You bought these bras for Won Seok.

566
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.420
Yes, I did. These are for Won Seok.

567
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.860
I'm going to wear these tonight.

568
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.900
Please.

569
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.369
And I'm not going to let him touch me at all.

570
00:36:36.269 --> 00:36:37.340
What?

571
00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:42.340
I'll be in touch after I get more information.

572
00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:44.579
Yes, thank you for everything.

573
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:48.249
And I've never properly introduced myself.

574
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.519
This is my business card.

575
00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.990
I'm also a CEO of a startup company.

576
00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:56.590
It's called "Get Up". It's an alarm application.

577
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.990
- "Get Up". - "Get Up".

578
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.860
Are you talking about the alarm application that wakes each other...

579
00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.429
- between friends? - Yes, that's right.

580
00:37:06.429 --> 00:37:08.229
Oh, you're the developer of "Get Up".

581
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:09.929
The one we all used the day before yesterday?

582
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.970
- Have you tried my application? - Yes, of course.

583
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.570
We were all amazed by the application after using it.

584
00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:15.639
Really?

585
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.840
We all wanted to ask the developer a question...

586
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.749
if we got to meet him.

587
00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:23.409
Yes, what is it? Ask away.

588
00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:25.550
Why did you...

589
00:37:26.249 --> 00:37:27.749
make that application?

590
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.019
Pardon?

591
00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:33.860
Oh, that's because... As you've used it, you'd know that...

592
00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:36.860
the users often don't hear the alarm and fall back asleep.

593
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.059
Then the alarm goes to the user's friend instead.

594
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.170
Then the friend calls the user and wakes him or her up.

595
00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:45.400
Don't we just need to set multiple alarms...

596
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.340
in different time?

597
00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:54.309
That could work. That's also a way.

598
00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:57.950
But our application's motto is connection between people.

599
00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.450
It's not just an ordinary alarm.

600
00:38:00.749 --> 00:38:02.389
It's a social media alarm.

601
00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:04.920
Couples or students who study together...

602
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.190
can take care of each others' mornings...

603
00:38:07.459 --> 00:38:09.630
and make their relationships better.

604
00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.099
But does that make money?

605
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:14.829
How much do you make per month?

606
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.900
Well...

607
00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:20.740
It doesn't...

608
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:22.740
make any money.

609
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:33.019
Shim Won Seok.

610
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.119
You better learn how grave a sin it was to reject the marriage.

611
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.860
You love see-through underwear. Let's see how long you can hold.

612
00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:53.809
Are you home?

613
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.720
What's wrong?

614
00:39:12.459 --> 00:39:13.659
Hey, Won Seok.

615
00:39:14.389 --> 00:39:16.360
Let me see your face. What's wrong?

616
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.400
Ho Rang.

617
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.740
What? They asked why you made that application?

618
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.380
What do they mean? You made it to make money.

619
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.079
What gibberish is that?

620
00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:41.050
Ho Rang.

621
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.760
I...

622
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.959
never imagined my application being treated that way.

623
00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:50.159
There are so many weird applications in this world.

624
00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:52.260
There's a hand warmer application.

625
00:39:53.559 --> 00:39:55.329
And there's an app to show off your wealth.

626
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.539
And there's even an app that helps scratch your back with vibration.

627
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.110
What's wrong with mine?

628
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:03.909
That's right. There's nothing wrong with "Get Up".

629
00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:07.010
Are they looking down on yours because they're number one seller...

630
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:08.349
and yours is in the 257th place?

631
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:15.690
I never thought Se Hee would be like that. He's ridiculous.

632
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.720
He rolled around the ground to not pay for the rearview mirror.

633
00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:22.590
What? He did?

634
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.369
This belongs here, and that belongs there.

635
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.510
Oh, right.

636
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.740
How many times do I have to tell you? You even broke them earlier.

637
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.209
That's because the customer...

638
00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:42.709
If a customer drops his or her cup, the server must go and catch it.

639
00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:44.550
- Isn't that right? - What?

640
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.220
I'll keep today's incident secret.

641
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.990
You owe me. You better pay back.

642
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.220
Hey.

643
00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:02.300
(Landlord)

644
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.300
Someone's calling you.

645
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.639
Oh, just a second.

646
00:41:13.979 --> 00:41:16.079
Hello? What's going on?

647
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.050
Well...

648
00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:23.979
Hello? What's going on?

649
00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.950
Well...

650
00:41:26.897 --> 00:41:29.966
I called to ask what time you're going home today.

651
00:41:30.366 --> 00:41:32.136
I think I'm going home at the regular time.

652
00:41:33.136 --> 00:41:34.207
Why do you ask?

653
00:41:34.537 --> 00:41:35.636
It's...

654
00:41:36.377 --> 00:41:39.647
because Arsenal has a derby match today.

655
00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:43.176
Okay.

656
00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:47.216
So you called because of that?

657
00:41:48.156 --> 00:41:49.656
I just wanted to let you know.

658
00:41:51.287 --> 00:41:53.696
Okay. Thank you.

659
00:41:53.857 --> 00:41:55.357
And also,

660
00:41:55.797 --> 00:41:58.466
are you going home by bus today?

661
00:41:58.966 --> 00:42:00.636
Yes, I think I am.

662
00:42:01.236 --> 00:42:02.866
Why do you ask that?

663
00:42:04.466 --> 00:42:06.267
Why do you keep asking...

664
00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:08.636
if I'm going home by bus?

665
00:42:08.937 --> 00:42:10.346
Well, that's...

666
00:42:11.207 --> 00:42:12.276
because...

667
00:42:12.806 --> 00:42:15.846
I think it'd be better to take bus.

668
00:42:16.176 --> 00:42:19.547
I mean, it's more efficient to take the bus,

669
00:42:19.547 --> 00:42:20.957
and it's also safer.

670
00:42:21.357 --> 00:42:22.386
I mean...

671
00:42:24.227 --> 00:42:26.687
The bus stops right in front of our place...

672
00:42:26.857 --> 00:42:28.026
without going elsewhere.

673
00:42:34.966 --> 00:42:38.366
Do I sound weird right now?

674
00:42:40.676 --> 00:42:41.707
Yes.

675
00:42:43.437 --> 00:42:44.576
Okay.

676
00:42:48.846 --> 00:42:50.147
What about Kitty?

677
00:42:50.547 --> 00:42:52.017
Did you go pick her up?

678
00:42:52.446 --> 00:42:54.486
No, I'm thinking of going later.

679
00:42:54.957 --> 00:42:56.187
Is Kitty...

680
00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:01.497
going home by taxi like earlier?

681
00:43:02.127 --> 00:43:05.026
Yes, since it's the rush hour,

682
00:43:05.466 --> 00:43:07.267
Kitty will be uneasy when there are many people on the bus.

683
00:43:10.207 --> 00:43:11.236
Okay.

684
00:43:11.607 --> 00:43:15.207
I'll see you when the match starts.

685
00:43:16.207 --> 00:43:17.247
Okay.

686
00:43:22.216 --> 00:43:23.317
What was that?

687
00:43:23.846 --> 00:43:25.486
Kitty gets to ride a taxi,

688
00:43:25.986 --> 00:43:29.817
and he calls me up to tell me to go home by bus?

689
00:43:31.687 --> 00:43:33.357
What has gotten into him?

690
00:43:42.636 --> 00:43:45.667
You have to pick up your cat by 7pm today.

691
00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:50.877
Can't you try harder?

692
00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:52.946
What's the point of practicing?

693
00:43:52.946 --> 00:43:54.477
I watched a video too.

694
00:43:54.776 --> 00:43:56.747
Oh, gosh. I don't think I can do it.

695
00:43:58.147 --> 00:43:59.486
That's why you can't succeed.

696
00:43:59.846 --> 00:44:01.587
Se Hee, can you solve this for us?

697
00:44:01.587 --> 00:44:02.957
Oh, right. You're good at this.

698
00:44:02.957 --> 00:44:04.326
You even set a new record last time.

699
00:44:04.326 --> 00:44:06.857
- Go, Se Hee. - Show us.

700
00:44:06.857 --> 00:44:08.826
- Go, Se Hee. - Show us.

701
00:44:10.026 --> 00:44:12.797
- All right! - I can't do it. How does it work?

702
00:45:01.547 --> 00:45:03.176
Why do you always leave first?

703
00:45:04.517 --> 00:45:05.616
Get on.

704
00:45:06.147 --> 00:45:07.357
It's okay.

705
00:45:07.886 --> 00:45:10.627
Why? Did your husband tell you to go by bus?

706
00:45:11.287 --> 00:45:12.326
What?

707
00:45:12.326 --> 00:45:13.627
I overheard it earlier.

708
00:45:13.826 --> 00:45:16.797
Don't you know I can hear everything through the window?

709
00:45:17.227 --> 00:45:18.326
You're dumb.

710
00:45:19.497 --> 00:45:20.667
I see.

711
00:45:22.136 --> 00:45:25.067
You go first. I'll take the bus today.

712
00:45:27.937 --> 00:45:29.607
You listen to your husband so well.

713
00:45:30.207 --> 00:45:31.676
He doesn't even come pick you up.

714
00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:37.287
It's not even that far. It's just one station away from his workplace.

715
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:39.247
How come he never comes to pick you up?

716
00:45:42.017 --> 00:45:44.486
He's really busy. That's why.

717
00:45:44.486 --> 00:45:46.187
Why? Because he's picking up his cat?

718
00:45:47.196 --> 00:45:50.426
So to him, you're in a lower priority than his cat.

719
00:45:55.136 --> 00:45:57.037
Get on. Let's go grab beer.

720
00:45:57.236 --> 00:45:59.067
You owe me, remember?

721
00:46:02.837 --> 00:46:05.076
Shall we go grab beer than?

722
00:46:28.397 --> 00:46:29.567
(Taxi)

723
00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:33.107
Please go to the veterinary clinic in front of Chungguk Station.

724
00:46:57.297 --> 00:46:58.426
Really?

725
00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:01.337
He rolled on the ground because he was avoiding the rearview mirror?

726
00:47:02.997 --> 00:47:04.366
He's unbelievable.

727
00:47:04.366 --> 00:47:07.607
Just like Sang Goo said, he only knows his cat and the loans.

728
00:47:07.837 --> 00:47:09.937
What do you mean?

729
00:47:09.937 --> 00:47:13.276
His colleagues say that he only thinks about his cat...

730
00:47:13.276 --> 00:47:14.817
and the loans he took out.

731
00:47:15.076 --> 00:47:17.346
The only thing he cares about is his loans,

732
00:47:17.486 --> 00:47:20.486
and the mere emotion he has goes to his cat.

733
00:47:20.716 --> 00:47:23.627
He never takes taxi because he has to pay back the loan,

734
00:47:23.756 --> 00:47:26.997
but he pays for taxi, surgery,

735
00:47:26.997 --> 00:47:28.797
and buys the most expensive cat food for the cat.

736
00:47:29.727 --> 00:47:31.897
He's really weird.

737
00:47:31.897 --> 00:47:33.026
I know.

738
00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:36.037
The people who work in this field are all weird,

739
00:47:36.037 --> 00:47:37.837
but he's the weirdest one.

740
00:47:38.267 --> 00:47:39.506
He even has new records.

741
00:47:40.006 --> 00:47:41.937
Records? What kind of records?

742
00:47:41.937 --> 00:47:43.006
Cube puzzle.

743
00:47:43.006 --> 00:47:45.877
He went on a cube puzzle competition and set a new record.

744
00:47:46.276 --> 00:47:47.377
A cube puzzle?

745
00:47:49.176 --> 00:47:53.287
Oh, you mean the kids' toy that the kids downstairs play with?

746
00:47:53.587 --> 00:47:55.886
Doesn't that take only a few twists?

747
00:47:56.017 --> 00:47:58.587
What? Ho Rang!

748
00:48:09.366 --> 00:48:10.537
Yes, Bo Mi.

749
00:48:10.537 --> 00:48:14.877
Se Hee, I asked my uncle who works as a policeman.

750
00:48:15.136 --> 00:48:17.346
You know, the case where a man locked up a woman.

751
00:48:17.406 --> 00:48:18.806
Yes, keep talking.

752
00:48:18.806 --> 00:48:20.346
They haven't figured out who the suspect is,

753
00:48:20.346 --> 00:48:23.116
and there was just one piece of evidence at the scene.

754
00:48:23.587 --> 00:48:25.017
What was it called?

755
00:48:25.346 --> 00:48:26.986
You know the ones you use to fasten bolts.

756
00:48:27.517 --> 00:48:29.787
- Is it called a spinner? - You mean a spanner?

757
00:48:29.917 --> 00:48:31.926
Oh, yes. That one. A spanner.

758
00:48:32.087 --> 00:48:34.227
The culprit left it at the scene and fled.

759
00:48:34.497 --> 00:48:35.926
I guess he used that as a weapon.

760
00:48:37.326 --> 00:48:41.397
Look here. Even if it seems easy, you have to calculate the moves.

761
00:48:41.397 --> 00:48:43.707
There are over 4 zillion possible moves in it.

762
00:48:43.806 --> 00:48:47.736
That's a less chance than winning lottery every day within two weeks.

763
00:48:47.806 --> 00:48:49.176
Where did you get that?

764
00:48:49.437 --> 00:48:51.877
- Is it from the downstairs? - Yes, I traded it with the squid.

765
00:48:51.877 --> 00:48:53.477
Be quiet. That's not what's important.

766
00:48:53.477 --> 00:48:55.747
You can't solve it if you just twist however you want.

767
00:48:55.747 --> 00:48:58.346
You can never solve it if you don't pay attention to it.

768
00:48:58.446 --> 00:49:01.687
You have to remember the equation in your head...

769
00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:04.787
and twist it one by one as if you're trying to find clues.

770
00:49:04.787 --> 00:49:08.326
You twist the blocks. This is the important part. Listen.

771
00:49:08.326 --> 00:49:11.667
Shut it! Stop that. We were just talking about Se Hee.

772
00:49:12.627 --> 00:49:14.337
You're talking about that cube puzzle for 30 minutes.

773
00:49:14.337 --> 00:49:15.767
What do I hate the most?

774
00:49:16.866 --> 00:49:18.636
Talking about games, equations,

775
00:49:18.636 --> 00:49:20.107
and game equations.

776
00:49:21.176 --> 00:49:24.406
I've told you this for seven years, and you never seem to know it.

777
00:49:24.776 --> 00:49:26.877
I'll never meet an engineering student again.

778
00:49:45.727 --> 00:49:47.696
Why? Do you think I'm dangerous?

779
00:49:49.437 --> 00:49:50.736
You're signature changed.

780
00:49:51.636 --> 00:49:53.506
Remember the case where a girl was locked up?

781
00:49:53.506 --> 00:49:54.937
I think the pattern is similar to this case.

782
00:49:56.377 --> 00:49:59.076
He was upset that he got blocked, so he kept stalking her.

783
00:49:59.076 --> 00:50:02.317
He kidnapped her with the address he got on the SNS.

784
00:50:03.817 --> 00:50:05.386
Oh, yes. That one. A spanner.

785
00:50:06.616 --> 00:50:08.116
I guess he used that as a weapon.

786
00:50:12.187 --> 00:50:13.596
I can fix a woman's heart.

787
00:50:15.397 --> 00:50:17.696
I have to get what I want to have.

788
00:50:36.417 --> 00:50:37.547
Sir.

789
00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:42.917
Arsenal has a derby match...

790
00:50:42.917 --> 00:50:44.627
today.

791
00:50:51.897 --> 00:50:53.366
This is nice.

792
00:50:54.897 --> 00:50:56.567
Why did you get married to your husband?

793
00:50:57.267 --> 00:50:58.337
What?

794
00:50:58.337 --> 00:51:00.207
There must be a reason you married him.

795
00:51:00.537 --> 00:51:01.776
What did you like about him?

796
00:51:04.477 --> 00:51:05.647
He's very thrifty.

797
00:51:06.477 --> 00:51:08.017
He's also good at leading his life.

798
00:51:09.116 --> 00:51:11.986
You saw how he behaved with the rearview mirror.

799
00:51:12.616 --> 00:51:14.886
Is that all? That's why you married him?

800
00:51:16.017 --> 00:51:17.886
He has a decent job.

801
00:51:19.227 --> 00:51:20.426
He even has his own place.

802
00:51:22.627 --> 00:51:25.426
Is that why you saved him as "Landlord" on your phone?

803
00:51:28.197 --> 00:51:29.666
This is nice.

804
00:51:31.197 --> 00:51:32.867
Why did you get married to your husband?

805
00:51:33.567 --> 00:51:34.637
What?

806
00:51:34.637 --> 00:51:36.507
There must be a reason you married him.

807
00:51:36.837 --> 00:51:38.076
What did you like about him?

808
00:51:40.777 --> 00:51:41.947
He's very thrifty.

809
00:51:42.777 --> 00:51:44.317
He's also good at leading his life.

810
00:51:45.416 --> 00:51:48.286
You saw how he behaved with the rearview mirror.

811
00:51:48.916 --> 00:51:51.186
Is that all? That's why you married him?

812
00:51:52.317 --> 00:51:54.186
He has a decent job.

813
00:51:55.527 --> 00:51:56.726
He even has his own place.

814
00:51:58.927 --> 00:52:01.726
Is that why you saved him as "Landlord" on your phone?

815
00:52:05.416 --> 00:52:07.085
I saw it on your phone...

816
00:52:07.746 --> 00:52:09.186
when he called you.

817
00:52:11.215 --> 00:52:15.286
It's like a nickname. Sort of.

818
00:52:16.255 --> 00:52:17.855
You mean he's not the actual landlord?

819
00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:21.226
He is.

820
00:52:22.465 --> 00:52:24.235
But I'm also paying for it.

821
00:52:24.666 --> 00:52:27.105
I'm doing a part-time job and recycling.

822
00:52:28.005 --> 00:52:29.366
I take care of the cat.

823
00:52:30.405 --> 00:52:33.945
And I sometimes make breakfast for him.

824
00:52:35.445 --> 00:52:38.016
That's quite rare actually.

825
00:52:41.585 --> 00:52:42.715
That's boring.

826
00:52:43.985 --> 00:52:48.085
I thought people get married for other reasons.

827
00:52:48.286 --> 00:52:51.255
I thought it'd be something like love or destiny.

828
00:52:52.525 --> 00:52:53.896
Marriage seems like nothing.

829
00:52:54.666 --> 00:52:56.025
It's like a part-time job.

830
00:52:56.625 --> 00:52:58.195
A trade between labor and capital.

831
00:53:21.525 --> 00:53:22.826
Are you very upset?

832
00:53:23.125 --> 00:53:24.655
Don't worry about it. It's not even the first time.

833
00:53:25.925 --> 00:53:28.826
I'm sorry. I just couldn't resist it.

834
00:53:29.666 --> 00:53:31.666
Don't kneel down like that. I hate looking at it.

835
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:32.695
Okay.

836
00:53:34.505 --> 00:53:36.005
This is not the only reason I'm upset at the moment.

837
00:53:36.235 --> 00:53:38.306
Why did you go to someone else's office and get beaten?

838
00:53:40.346 --> 00:53:42.445
They are ridiculous.

839
00:53:42.706 --> 00:53:46.476
Why do they care so much about what others make?

840
00:53:49.545 --> 00:53:50.585
Ho Rang.

841
00:53:54.025 --> 00:53:55.985
Why do you want to marry me?

842
00:53:57.096 --> 00:53:59.025
- What? - My work is not getting...

843
00:53:59.826 --> 00:54:02.795
any investment and I've been spending three years like this.

844
00:54:04.195 --> 00:54:06.806
I don't have money, car, or house.

845
00:54:07.166 --> 00:54:08.436
I have nothing.

846
00:54:08.735 --> 00:54:10.505
Why do you want to marry me?

847
00:54:11.636 --> 00:54:13.945
What are you talking about? I want it because it's you.

848
00:54:15.005 --> 00:54:16.146
Do you want it because it's me?

849
00:54:16.545 --> 00:54:19.715
Yes, because it's you, Won Seok.

850
00:54:20.985 --> 00:54:22.286
Do I need more reasons?

851
00:55:01.186 --> 00:55:02.625
Because it's him.

852
00:55:05.396 --> 00:55:07.596
I married him because it's him.

853
00:55:09.366 --> 00:55:11.065
I'm not going to say...

854
00:55:12.565 --> 00:55:15.065
his job and his house didn't play a part.

855
00:55:17.275 --> 00:55:18.976
If it was someone else,

856
00:55:20.146 --> 00:55:23.976
I wouldn't have married that person, even with the same conditions.

857
00:55:26.576 --> 00:55:28.416
So please don't say that.

858
00:55:29.616 --> 00:55:31.886
I know marriage is not something amazing.

859
00:55:33.215 --> 00:55:36.795
But it doesn't mean it's nothing that some strangers...

860
00:55:38.125 --> 00:55:39.596
can look down on.

861
00:55:45.166 --> 00:55:46.766
So I'm a stranger...

862
00:55:47.465 --> 00:55:48.706
to you.

863
00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:51.976
So...

864
00:55:52.775 --> 00:55:56.146
do you think your husband will come save you if anything happens now?

865
00:55:57.545 --> 00:55:59.146
- What? - I mean,

866
00:55:59.746 --> 00:56:01.616
even if you think that way,

867
00:56:01.985 --> 00:56:04.715
he is busy taking care of his cat and telling you to take the bus.

868
00:56:05.556 --> 00:56:07.226
He doesn't care about you.

869
00:56:07.485 --> 00:56:08.556
Bok Nam.

870
00:56:09.425 --> 00:56:11.625
Why are you dissing him so much?

871
00:56:13.596 --> 00:56:14.795
Why are you not answering my questions?

872
00:56:15.166 --> 00:56:17.695
I guess you are not sure if your husband will come get you or not.

873
00:56:19.266 --> 00:56:21.306
No, I'm not sure about that.

874
00:56:22.136 --> 00:56:23.206
Are you satisfied now?

875
00:56:26.375 --> 00:56:29.545
Why did you marry a fake husband?

876
00:56:32.315 --> 00:56:33.416
What?

877
00:56:34.485 --> 00:56:35.786
I'm done with my beer.

878
00:56:36.855 --> 00:56:37.956
Do you want another one?

879
00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:44.025
What did you just say?

880
00:56:46.896 --> 00:56:48.396
Why are you surprised so much?

881
00:56:49.295 --> 00:56:50.866
Do you think I didn't know that?

882
00:56:52.636 --> 00:56:55.166
I'm interested in you more than you think.

883
00:56:55.806 --> 00:56:57.306
I'm not a stranger.

884
00:57:54.866 --> 00:57:56.525
Let's go watch soccer.

885
00:57:58.335 --> 00:57:59.465
What are you doing now?

886
00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:01.965
Let go.

887
00:58:02.766 --> 00:58:05.105
What if I don't? Are you going to punch me?

888
00:58:05.275 --> 00:58:07.806
No, I don't punch people.

889
00:58:08.806 --> 00:58:10.146
That will cost me too much.

890
00:58:20.655 --> 00:58:22.355
I found out...

891
00:58:22.886 --> 00:58:24.925
your motorcycle's an expensive one.

892
00:58:25.755 --> 00:58:28.366
I will pay back until the year 2048 while paying back for my house.

893
00:58:33.266 --> 00:58:34.806
My bike!

894
00:59:05.335 --> 00:59:06.565
Come on.

895
00:59:09.605 --> 00:59:12.675
Let's go to our home.

896
00:59:15.306 --> 00:59:17.146
We can't understand each other...

897
00:59:18.545 --> 00:59:20.516
if we don't try.

898
00:59:22.945 --> 00:59:24.315
Even though the world is like this...

899
00:59:35.565 --> 00:59:36.996
Still,

900
00:59:40.735 --> 00:59:41.965
love exists.

901
01:00:03.286 --> 01:00:07.065
(Because This is My First Life)

902
01:00:07.266 --> 01:00:09.766
You are home. Why did you call me then?

903
01:00:09.866 --> 01:00:12.396
Because you are someone I can trust. That's why I did it.

904
01:00:12.936 --> 01:00:15.136
Do you think he knows about our contract?

905
01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:17.835
Why did you save my name as the landlord in your phone?

906
01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:21.476
You didn't tell me this, but I guess he's pretty devoted, right?

907
01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:25.576
Call me your hubby in front of others.

908
01:00:26.016 --> 01:00:27.445
Why are you looking at me like that?

909
01:00:27.945 --> 01:00:30.215
How did you know that?

910
01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:33.085
Come to your senses!

911
01:00:34.556 --> 01:00:35.655
Why is he doing that?

912
01:00:35.786 --> 01:00:37.925
Look at your fingernails! It's so dirty.

913
01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.525
Take a look at it again! It's not dirty at all.

914
01:00:39.655 --> 01:00:41.866
Would you marry me?

915
01:00:42.525 --> 01:00:46.396
There's someone I like. It's my husband.
