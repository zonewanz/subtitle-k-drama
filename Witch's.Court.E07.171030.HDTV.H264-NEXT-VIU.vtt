3
00:00:07.713 --> 00:00:09.752
You're from Janghyeon-dong?

4
00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:11.182
Pretty much.

5
00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:13.783
I was born in Yeongpa or somewhere,

6
00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.252
but when I was one, I moved to Janghyeon-dong.

7
00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:18.423
Do you know Janghyeon-dong?

8
00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:20.062
Have you been?

9
00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:21.263
Yes.

10
00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:23.763
I went once when I was a senior in high school.

11
00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:25.292
A senior?

12
00:00:25.763 --> 00:00:26.763
Why?

13
00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.963
I had to find someone.

14
00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:34.102
This lady I know asked me to find her family.

15
00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:36.473
I see. Who?

16
00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.412
It's a long story.

17
00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:42.342
Anyway, she had a noodle soup restaurant,

18
00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:44.613
and she was looking for her daughter.

19
00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:52.053
Hold on.

20
00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:56.263
You met whom?

21
00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:00.233
That lady with a noodles place in Janghyeon-dong.

22
00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:02.162
Was her name by chance...

23
00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:03.802
No, no, no.

24
00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:06.802
I'm sure that's the name. I'm positive.

25
00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.573
What's wrong? Are you okay?

26
00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:10.713
That lady that you met.

27
00:01:13.612 --> 00:01:14.983
She's my mom.

28
00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:17.082
She disappeared 20 years ago.

29
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:19.853
She had a noodles place in Janghyeon-dong,

30
00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:21.282
had one daughter, and...

31
00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:22.653
Yes, that's my mom.

32
00:01:23.422 --> 00:01:25.123
Where did you meet my mom?

33
00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:31.192
She was being treated in my mom's hospital.

34
00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.532
But her name was Kim Mi Jung.

35
00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:39.133
What about her face?

36
00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:41.202
That woman...

37
00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:44.812
Kim Mi Jung may have been my mom.

38
00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:48.913
(Psychiatrist Ko Jae Sook )

39
00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:53.823
This woman...

40
00:01:57.653 --> 00:01:59.422
is not Kim Mi Jung.

41
00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.692
I treated her over 10 years ago,

42
00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:05.263
so I don't remember clearly,

43
00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.962
but she definitely did not look like this.

44
00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.503
Do you have her photo...

45
00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:11.872
or medical records?

46
00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:16.642
It sounds so similar to my mom.

47
00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:21.642
The hospital does not keep photos of patients.

48
00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.712
Medical records are destroyed after 10 years.

49
00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:29.283
Sorry I couldn't help.

50
00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:33.293
It's not your fault.

51
00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:34.992
Sorry for troubling you.

52
00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.503
Ms. Ma.

53
00:02:41.163 --> 00:02:43.133
There's a way to find Kim Min Jung.

54
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:45.033
Don't you remember?

55
00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:47.372
I went to the police in Janghyeon-dong...

56
00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:49.073
to find her family.

57
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:53.712
The detective I met then said he knew her well.

58
00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:57.313
Detective? Which detective?

59
00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:04.193
Detective Baek Sang Ho?

60
00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:07.522
He worked here for about two months.

61
00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:09.832
He quit for personal reasons.

62
00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:12.593
I heard he emigrated. But...

63
00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:14.462
why are you looking for him?

64
00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.832
We need to find someone.

65
00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:20.603
Who is it? I'll help you.

66
00:03:24.813 --> 00:03:26.343
(Kim Mi Jung)

67
00:03:26.343 --> 00:03:27.642
(0 results)

68
00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:30.483
This won't work. I mean,

69
00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:33.082
I need at least an address or something.

70
00:03:33.082 --> 00:03:35.323
The only leads are Janghyeon-dong...

71
00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:36.622
and the name Kim Mi Jung.

72
00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:38.492
Don't you know anything else?

73
00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:40.823
It's okay. Thank you.

74
00:03:54.642 --> 00:03:55.642
Are you okay?

75
00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.043
I'm okay.

76
00:03:58.043 --> 00:04:00.013
This wasn't the first time.

77
00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:02.582
Don't get me started.

78
00:04:02.712 --> 00:04:04.513
I went to every hospital...

79
00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.622
in the country looking for my mom.

80
00:04:08.582 --> 00:04:10.823
I was afraid she was sold off somewhere,

81
00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.122
so I searched during work too.

82
00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:17.192
Anytime there was an unidentified body,

83
00:04:17.192 --> 00:04:18.692
it killed me.

84
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:20.562
On days like that,

85
00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:22.632
I can't do anything...

86
00:04:22.632 --> 00:04:23.932
until I check the body.

87
00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:27.002
I even went...

88
00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.572
to a morgue in the middle of the night.

89
00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:32.773
But...

90
00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:39.052
I should've searched more.

91
00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:44.122
You said that Kim Mi Jung person...

92
00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:47.992
searched for her daughter too.

93
00:04:51.432 --> 00:04:53.403
Something may have happened to my mom...

94
00:04:53.963 --> 00:04:56.903
which may have been why she couldn't find me.

95
00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.973
What if she's crying because she misses me?

96
00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:06.583
That's why I should've searched more.

97
00:05:07.242 --> 00:05:10.252
I shouldn't have... What's wrong with me?

98
00:05:13.382 --> 00:05:15.023
Just a minute.

99
00:05:17.322 --> 00:05:19.192
Seriously.

100
00:05:19.692 --> 00:05:21.523
This is so humiliating.

101
00:05:23.893 --> 00:05:25.492
What's wrong with me?

102
00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:00.103
What happened?

103
00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.632
I had a friend there, so he took care of it.

104
00:06:16.882 --> 00:06:18.312
(Yeo Jin Wook)

105
00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:21.723
Please...

106
00:06:22.122 --> 00:06:24.192
find me her address.

107
00:06:24.723 --> 00:06:27.663
(Kim Mi Jung)

108
00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:30.192
I went to the address listed,

109
00:06:30.192 --> 00:06:31.663
and it was a test prep center.

110
00:06:32.062 --> 00:06:34.403
And they didn't know a Kim Mi Jung.

111
00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:44.213
This woman is very sick right now.

112
00:06:46.543 --> 00:06:49.143
But she's looking for her daughter.

113
00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.593
Kim... Kim Mi Jung?

114
00:06:56.593 --> 00:06:58.793
What? Do you know her?

115
00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:00.163
Of course.

116
00:07:00.262 --> 00:07:01.422
She had a daughter...

117
00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:02.793
who died in an accident.

118
00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:05.733
The shock sent her in and out of mental hospitals,

119
00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:07.903
and she would ask...

120
00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:09.603
anyone she met to find her daughter.

121
00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:12.372
Many came by here, just like you.

122
00:07:17.012 --> 00:07:18.273
Then...

123
00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:20.612
what about other family members?

124
00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:23.853
Family?

125
00:07:28.523 --> 00:07:29.723
Baek Sang Ho speaking.

126
00:07:31.153 --> 00:07:34.122
I told you that I'd call you.

127
00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:35.723
Yes.

128
00:07:42.703 --> 00:07:44.473
Yes, I understand.

129
00:07:49.203 --> 00:07:52.413
Ko Jae Sook's son came by?

130
00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.413
Yes. I made up a story and sent him away,

131
00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:57.713
but I think...

132
00:07:58.252 --> 00:07:59.882
we should move Kwak Young Shil.

133
00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.122
Sang Ho.

134
00:08:08.163 --> 00:08:11.333
Did you do a 100m sprint when you were in school?

135
00:08:12.463 --> 00:08:13.502
Pardon?

136
00:08:13.903 --> 00:08:16.203
You're waiting at the starting line,

137
00:08:16.473 --> 00:08:19.273
but you can feel a pebble in your shoe.

138
00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.572
What would you do?

139
00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:24.913
Will you try and take out the pebble,

140
00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:27.343
or will you just run with the pain?

141
00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:31.552
Then, Kwak Young Shil...

142
00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:39.792
I trust you.

143
00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:02.843
Yeongpa's Dong-gu...

144
00:09:02.843 --> 00:09:05.412
was always Future Party's home.

145
00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:08.453
If you can support us,

146
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:11.292
I'll make sure to visit you again.

147
00:09:13.593 --> 00:09:16.733
Gold isn't worth much these days.

148
00:09:19.632 --> 00:09:20.803
I heard that your wife...

149
00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:24.902
is in the States because of your son.

150
00:09:27.502 --> 00:09:28.642
Seol.

151
00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:45.353
Sit down.

152
00:09:50.693 --> 00:09:53.532
She's just starting as a new actress.

153
00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:57.402
She needs your help to grow.

154
00:10:07.183 --> 00:10:10.083
There's a hidden lobby in Hyungjae Hotel?

155
00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:13.053
Did you see anyone?

156
00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:15.223
What about Cho Gap Soo?

157
00:10:16.183 --> 00:10:19.522
I went straight to a room, so I didn't see anyone.

158
00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:24.193
You did a lot just by finding this out.

159
00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:26.392
You should take care of yourself for now.

160
00:10:27.103 --> 00:10:30.132
I didn't get involved to give up so easily.

161
00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:33.032
It's not something we can act rashly with.

162
00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:34.603
We have to prepare more.

163
00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:40.483
My sister.

164
00:10:42.382 --> 00:10:43.853
You didn't forget her, did you?

165
00:10:47.122 --> 00:10:49.183
I started this because I trust you.

166
00:10:52.353 --> 00:10:54.063
I'm afraid I might lose you too.

167
00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.132
I'll call you.

168
00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:30.292
(Se Na's Dad)

169
00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:41.443
The number you have dialed is not available.

170
00:11:43.213 --> 00:11:45.843
Hello, it's Yi Deum.

171
00:11:46.742 --> 00:11:48.183
Yi Deum from Janghyeon-dong.

172
00:11:49.142 --> 00:11:50.553
Is Se Na doing well?

173
00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:56.223
Have you heard any news about Mom?

174
00:11:58.292 --> 00:11:59.762
I'm sorry to bother you out of the blue.

175
00:11:59.992 --> 00:12:02.563
If you know anything, please let me know.

176
00:12:03.292 --> 00:12:04.392
Take care.

177
00:12:29.423 --> 00:12:31.892
(Missing)

178
00:13:03.252 --> 00:13:05.752
You look exactly like what I predicted.

179
00:13:06.463 --> 00:13:09.022
- If you're done, goodbye. - Ms. Ma.

180
00:13:10.032 --> 00:13:11.392
You should come somewhere with me.

181
00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:13.963
Are you crazy?

182
00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:16.502
You don't expect me to climb that, do you?

183
00:13:16.803 --> 00:13:18.103
Why do you think we're here?

184
00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:19.803
I hate climbing.

185
00:13:19.803 --> 00:13:23.313
Why bother going up if we're coming back down?

186
00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:26.782
Also, it's a plain wall. I'm not Spiderman.

187
00:13:32.882 --> 00:13:34.083
What are you doing?

188
00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:44.933
I said, what are you doing?

189
00:13:52.772 --> 00:13:55.402
You should still try. It'll be fun.

190
00:13:56.512 --> 00:13:57.542
Good luck.

191
00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:04.083
But... Why are you being so sweet?

192
00:14:05.652 --> 00:14:08.053
This is why I wasn't going to date.

193
00:14:14.323 --> 00:14:16.492
I can't do it. I can't.

194
00:14:16.892 --> 00:14:18.632
I can't do this.

195
00:14:24.272 --> 00:14:26.573
I can't do it. No, no.

196
00:14:32.213 --> 00:14:34.242
This is crazy. How can anyone do this?

197
00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:37.412
Save me.

198
00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:39.553
Hey! Yeo.

199
00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:53.603
How was it? It's not so bad, right?

200
00:14:54.762 --> 00:14:56.733
I almost punched you, but I stopped myself.

201
00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:58.073
I'm so sore.

202
00:15:23.463 --> 00:15:24.862
Are we here?

203
00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:27.563
Gosh, my shoulders. My whole body aches.

204
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:28.902
It was hard, right?

205
00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:30.433
I almost died.

206
00:15:30.673 --> 00:15:33.303
How is this a date? It's like a drill.

207
00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:35.142
At least you couldn't think about anything else.

208
00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:37.372
How can I think when I'm dying?

209
00:15:37.473 --> 00:15:38.612
Exactly.

210
00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.343
You forgot how sad you were too.

211
00:15:43.213 --> 00:15:44.782
The day's almost over.

212
00:15:46.823 --> 00:15:50.353
Don't blame yourself for not finding your mom.

213
00:15:51.093 --> 00:15:53.053
You've been through enough already.

214
00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:55.463
You had enough heartaches.

215
00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.632
It's time for you to let it go.

216
00:16:07.242 --> 00:16:08.272
Also,

217
00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:10.313
here.

218
00:16:10.843 --> 00:16:12.973
- What is it? - Open it.

219
00:16:16.882 --> 00:16:20.622
I know a professor who does 3D e-fits.

220
00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:23.622
I took the wanted poster and asked for a favor.

221
00:16:24.193 --> 00:16:25.423
He made it for me.

222
00:16:26.492 --> 00:16:29.063
If you imagine her with you looking like this,

223
00:16:29.862 --> 00:16:31.593
you'll be less lonely.

224
00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:36.303
You can look at this whenever you miss her.

225
00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:14.873
Thank you for the picture.

226
00:17:14.873 --> 00:17:18.542
(Thank you for the picture.)

227
00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.812
- It's nothing... - Also,

228
00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:22.883
let's start dating from today.

229
00:17:22.983 --> 00:17:25.613
Just say yes or no so that it's clear.

230
00:17:26.653 --> 00:17:28.123
Ms. Ma.

231
00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:30.153
What are you doing?

232
00:17:30.393 --> 00:17:32.292
Why does it take so long to say yes or no?

233
00:17:32.723 --> 00:17:34.123
Just hurry up and say it.

234
00:17:36.163 --> 00:17:37.762
How is she so fast?

235
00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:46.403
I'll say no for today.

236
00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:48.443
- What? - Goodnight.

237
00:17:50.012 --> 00:17:52.213
What's this? Then what about tomorrow?

238
00:17:52.913 --> 00:17:55.183
What about the day after? When will you say yes?

239
00:17:55.413 --> 00:17:56.483
Yeo.

240
00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:05.592
Are you serious?

241
00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:07.992
Yeo. Are you sleeping?

242
00:18:09.393 --> 00:18:10.393
Yeo!

243
00:18:11.762 --> 00:18:13.133
Hey!

244
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.203
No!

245
00:18:14.203 --> 00:18:16.873
Hey! Gosh!

(17-year-old girl, dreams come true)

248
00:18:22.873 --> 00:18:24.113
Can we meet now?

249
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.683
Yes. How old are you?

250
00:18:27.483 --> 00:18:28.643
I'm 32.

251
00:18:29.143 --> 00:18:30.213
You're older.

252
00:18:30.653 --> 00:18:31.713
Where are you now?

253
00:18:31.983 --> 00:18:34.123
In a car. I can come anywhere.

254
00:18:34.883 --> 00:18:36.082
Can you pay in advance?

255
00:18:36.082 --> 00:18:37.252
(Can you pay in advance?)

256
00:18:37.252 --> 00:18:38.852
Picture first.

257
00:18:40.423 --> 00:18:41.663
Good, good.

258
00:18:45.832 --> 00:18:47.062
You too.

259
00:18:51.332 --> 00:18:53.302
What is this?

260
00:18:53.302 --> 00:18:54.302
(Cyber Investigation Team 2)

261
00:18:54.302 --> 00:18:56.373
Cyber Team, Detective Kim.

262
00:18:56.373 --> 00:18:57.373
(Kim Duk Yul)

263
00:18:57.613 --> 00:18:59.012
You should go home.

264
00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:06.723
(Cyber Investigation Team 2)

265
00:19:07.453 --> 00:19:10.393
It's a sex trade case through a 1-on-1 chat app.

266
00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:13.623
The pimp is currently being investigated.

267
00:19:14.193 --> 00:19:16.163
He can sneak out of any trap.

268
00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:17.792
His nickname is Eel because of it.

269
00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:19.693
How many girls does he have?

270
00:19:19.903 --> 00:19:21.602
There are 10 to 15.

271
00:19:21.903 --> 00:19:22.903
The age group is...

272
00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:25.473
from middle school girls to university students.

273
00:19:27.242 --> 00:19:30.143
I was wondering why we didn't get this before.

274
00:19:30.143 --> 00:19:31.143
I agree.

275
00:19:31.342 --> 00:19:34.582
I was trying to carry out a sting operation...

276
00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:35.842
and downloaded the chatting app.

277
00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.582
I set my profile as a 16-year-old girl.

278
00:19:38.582 --> 00:19:40.723
I had 30 new messages in just 3 seconds.

279
00:19:40.723 --> 00:19:42.383
What's wrong with you guys?

280
00:19:42.383 --> 00:19:44.623
I didn't say I did that...

281
00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:46.963
Can I ask a question?

282
00:19:48.762 --> 00:19:50.532
That Eel or whatever...

283
00:19:50.532 --> 00:19:53.502
is still running lose.

284
00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:55.802
We can send him to court after he's caught.

285
00:19:56.032 --> 00:19:58.433
It's too early to start a discussion.

286
00:19:58.433 --> 00:20:01.173
Gosh, don't tell me this is like the 80s...

287
00:20:01.173 --> 00:20:02.973
when we had joint crackdowns...

288
00:20:02.973 --> 00:20:04.542
with the police.

289
00:20:05.373 --> 00:20:06.643
They already know the faces...

290
00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:07.883
of the officers in charge.

291
00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:10.653
The assigned station asked CAGU for help.

292
00:20:11.052 --> 00:20:13.012
From arrest to interrogation,

293
00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:14.352
we'll be working together.

294
00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:17.223
Does this mean Mr. Koo will be going on site...

295
00:20:17.292 --> 00:20:18.893
in a customer disguise?

296
00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:20.623
- Me? - No way.

297
00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:22.163
Not Mr. Koo.

298
00:20:22.163 --> 00:20:24.332
He looks like a detective.

299
00:20:24.332 --> 00:20:25.663
They'll find out right away.

300
00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:27.203
Then Yeo should go.

301
00:20:27.203 --> 00:20:29.463
Why? Why should Yeo go?

302
00:20:29.502 --> 00:20:30.703
Ms. Ma.

303
00:20:31.133 --> 00:20:32.373
I'm okay with it.

304
00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:34.042
Stay back.

305
00:20:34.143 --> 00:20:36.643
You saw Eel's picture.

306
00:20:36.643 --> 00:20:38.542
He looks very evil.

307
00:20:38.772 --> 00:20:40.312
Yeo is a bookworm.

308
00:20:40.312 --> 00:20:42.312
He'd be a horrible fighter.

309
00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:44.082
What if they find out he's undercover?

310
00:20:44.213 --> 00:20:46.213
What if Eel grabs a weapon and fights him?

311
00:20:46.282 --> 00:20:47.282
Well?

312
00:20:47.623 --> 00:20:50.252
What if there's a blade pointed at him again?

313
00:20:50.893 --> 00:20:53.393
Since you care so much about your junior,

314
00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:55.893
you should go with him.

315
00:20:58.262 --> 00:20:59.693
Could I do that?

316
00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:02.703
What's wrong with her?

317
00:21:10.012 --> 00:21:11.473
Thank you for coming.

318
00:21:11.473 --> 00:21:12.473
No problem.

319
00:21:14.282 --> 00:21:15.383
This is...

320
00:21:15.812 --> 00:21:17.552
the room Eel created.

321
00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:19.213
How do you know that?

322
00:21:19.413 --> 00:21:20.923
He always has the same room name.

323
00:21:20.923 --> 00:21:23.052
It's so that his regulars would recognize it.

324
00:21:23.052 --> 00:21:25.052
He's telling everyone it's him.

325
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:27.292
He's confident...

326
00:21:27.292 --> 00:21:28.592
he'll never get caught.

327
00:21:28.592 --> 00:21:30.262
It's very frustrating.

328
00:21:30.262 --> 00:21:32.133
Let me get into the chat room first.

329
00:21:33.802 --> 00:21:35.133
Have you done this before?

330
00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:36.903
You can't be too obvious.

331
00:21:37.032 --> 00:21:38.433
I'm Yeo Jin Wook.

332
00:21:38.903 --> 00:21:40.443
An ex-psychiatrist.

333
00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:42.502
Right.

334
00:21:46.683 --> 00:21:47.913
(Yeo Jin Wook)

335
00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:51.683
Are you crazy? Why are you using your real name?

336
00:21:53.012 --> 00:21:55.423
You're supposed to use a nickname.

337
00:21:55.423 --> 00:21:58.822
It should be "Charming" or "Mr. Good Looking".

338
00:22:05.562 --> 00:22:06.963
(Mr. Charming)

339
00:22:10.403 --> 00:22:11.802

340
00:22:12.933 --> 00:22:14.473
I got in.

341
00:22:17.213 --> 00:22:18.242
Hello.

342
00:22:19.312 --> 00:22:21.742
Nice to meet you.

343
00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:27.082
Yes. How old are you?

344
00:22:27.252 --> 00:22:29.522
I'm 34.

345
00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:32.923
I'm a little older than you, right?

346
00:22:33.092 --> 00:22:34.262
Where are you right now?

347
00:22:39.963 --> 00:22:40.963
I'm not sure.

348
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:45.173
Perhaps, in your heart?

349
00:22:47.403 --> 00:22:49.242
Are you...

350
00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:50.413
(Mr. Charming has been kicked out.)

351
00:22:56.012 --> 00:22:58.312
I think it's important to build a rapport.

352
00:22:58.312 --> 00:22:59.683
What's a rapport?

353
00:23:00.022 --> 00:23:01.423
A close and harmonious relationship...

354
00:23:01.423 --> 00:23:02.752
built by the counselor and the one...

355
00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:03.822
- being counseled. - Forget it.

356
00:23:03.822 --> 00:23:06.052
Use abbreviations and talk like you're young.

357
00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:07.163
Try again.

358
00:23:08.163 --> 00:23:09.163
Okay.

359
00:23:12.963 --> 00:23:13.963
What's up?

360
00:23:14.703 --> 00:23:15.802
How is it hanging?

361
00:23:17.873 --> 00:23:19.102
Up for a conditional meeting?

362
00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:20.673
You want to call me?

363
00:23:22.242 --> 00:23:24.173
No, I'm asking you how much you'll pay.

364
00:23:24.173 --> 00:23:25.213
What?

365
00:23:26.312 --> 00:23:27.512
What does this stand for?

366
00:23:28.312 --> 00:23:29.312
What did you...

367
00:23:29.312 --> 00:23:30.383
(Pure Love Macho has been kicked out.)

368
00:23:32.552 --> 00:23:33.552
Move over.

369
00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:37.123
Conditional.

370
00:23:37.822 --> 00:23:39.052
Can you meet now?

371
00:23:40.463 --> 00:23:42.193
- Price? - 200 dollars.

372
00:23:42.193 --> 00:23:44.693
- Done. - Are you really 17?

373
00:23:44.832 --> 00:23:46.663
Yes. Refund if not.

374
00:23:46.663 --> 00:23:48.703
Picture. Go.

375
00:23:50.873 --> 00:23:51.973
Check.

376
00:23:59.473 --> 00:24:00.483
Go.

377
00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:04.153
Okay. Yeonshin Station exit 8 in 10 minutes.

378
00:24:04.153 --> 00:24:05.153
There.

379
00:24:11.322 --> 00:24:12.852
Okay. Exit eight.

380
00:24:12.852 --> 00:24:13.893
Let's go.

381
00:24:29.812 --> 00:24:31.542
Real Cute Guy? Follow me.

382
00:24:59.173 --> 00:25:01.542
We should block all escape routes.

383
00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:02.842
Eel's girls...

384
00:25:02.842 --> 00:25:05.072
are just like their pimp. They're good at fleeing.

385
00:25:05.072 --> 00:25:07.242
Detective Lee and I will stay undercover...

386
00:25:07.242 --> 00:25:08.842
at the front door and the back door.

387
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:10.512
You should...

388
00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:13.623
go on standby somewhere close.

389
00:25:13.623 --> 00:25:15.623
Okay. Good luck.

390
00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:18.322
If it were me,

391
00:25:20.822 --> 00:25:22.322
I'd go that way.

392
00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:32.173
Money first.

393
00:25:33.703 --> 00:25:36.143
There are a lot of guys who change their minds.

394
00:25:41.443 --> 00:25:42.512
(Prosecution Service)

395
00:25:44.012 --> 00:25:45.213
I didn't do anything.

396
00:25:45.213 --> 00:25:46.522
I'm not guilty.

397
00:25:46.522 --> 00:25:47.522
Calm down.

398
00:25:47.923 --> 00:25:49.822
You're not who we're after.

399
00:25:50.052 --> 00:25:51.752
We're after the pimp that hired you.

400
00:25:52.292 --> 00:25:54.123
- The pimp? - Eel.

401
00:25:54.762 --> 00:25:55.992
Your boss.

402
00:25:56.863 --> 00:25:58.092
If you cooperate,

403
00:25:58.092 --> 00:25:59.492
you won't receive criminal penalties.

404
00:26:04.832 --> 00:26:05.903
Okay.

405
00:26:06.772 --> 00:26:08.542
I can leave if I cooperate, right?

406
00:26:11.272 --> 00:26:13.383
Let me go to the washroom first.

407
00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:29.663
The police are here.

408
00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:31.863
I'll run, so you should too.

409
00:26:53.782 --> 00:26:56.322
Wow, you're good at climbing down.

410
00:26:58.592 --> 00:26:59.863
You should be careful.

411
00:26:59.893 --> 00:27:02.363
I climbed many fences in my days,

412
00:27:02.463 --> 00:27:03.992
and I can tell this much height...

413
00:27:03.992 --> 00:27:05.433
will give you a fracture.

414
00:27:05.933 --> 00:27:08.532
If you don't want a bone to break, go back up.

415
00:27:15.302 --> 00:27:16.613
Help her up.

416
00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:18.512
Come up. I'll help you.

417
00:27:32.352 --> 00:27:35.022
Kong Soo Ah, you're a professional.

418
00:27:36.433 --> 00:27:37.663
It's all useless though.

419
00:27:37.663 --> 00:27:38.893
We can easily restore it.

420
00:27:39.463 --> 00:27:40.532
Go ahead.

421
00:27:41.332 --> 00:27:42.532
Where's Eel?

422
00:27:43.173 --> 00:27:44.332
Where does he work?

423
00:27:44.973 --> 00:27:48.403
Eel? Maybe in restaurants?

424
00:27:48.742 --> 00:27:49.973
Or maybe the mud flats?

425
00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:51.643
I'm talking about your pimp.

426
00:27:51.643 --> 00:27:54.113
The broker who helps you find men for prostitution.

427
00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:55.282
Gosh.

428
00:27:55.713 --> 00:27:57.153
What is a pimp?

429
00:27:58.552 --> 00:27:59.822
Don't waste your energy,

430
00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:01.082
and just tell me.

431
00:28:01.822 --> 00:28:03.792
I have no idea what you're talking about.

432
00:28:04.123 --> 00:28:05.322
Should I call your parents?

433
00:28:05.893 --> 00:28:07.522
So you could understand?

434
00:28:07.693 --> 00:28:09.863
As you wish. I have no idea what...

435
00:28:10.933 --> 00:28:12.963
What? Are you acting again?

436
00:28:13.602 --> 00:28:14.703
Do you need the bathroom?

437
00:28:15.002 --> 00:28:16.002
No.

438
00:28:17.272 --> 00:28:18.602
It really hurts.

439
00:28:18.873 --> 00:28:20.403
That won't make me go easy on you.

440
00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:21.943
It hurts.

441
00:28:22.602 --> 00:28:23.873
I mean it.

442
00:28:24.312 --> 00:28:25.973
Something seems wrong.

443
00:28:26.883 --> 00:28:28.012
Go in.

444
00:28:28.413 --> 00:28:29.483
Okay.

445
00:28:30.512 --> 00:28:31.582
Hey.

446
00:28:32.183 --> 00:28:34.052
Hey. What's wrong?

447
00:28:35.022 --> 00:28:36.153
Are you okay?

448
00:28:42.693 --> 00:28:43.792
Come in.

449
00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:48.733
Why do they sell their bodies, not caring...

450
00:28:48.733 --> 00:28:50.373
that they're hurting themselves?

451
00:28:51.002 --> 00:28:52.473
It isn't the kids' fault.

452
00:28:53.002 --> 00:28:55.203
Adults who buy kids with money are the problem.

453
00:28:55.403 --> 00:28:56.913
I wish men like that...

454
00:28:56.913 --> 00:28:59.173
would have something written on their faces...

455
00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:01.542
so that you can run away as soon as you see them.

456
00:29:05.213 --> 00:29:06.983
Ms. Son.

457
00:29:07.352 --> 00:29:09.552
Your face is all pink.

458
00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:11.822
- What is it? - Is it?

459
00:29:12.653 --> 00:29:13.723
That's right.

460
00:29:14.592 --> 00:29:16.693
You had a blind date, right?

461
00:29:17.933 --> 00:29:20.002
You must've liked the guy.

462
00:29:20.002 --> 00:29:21.133
What is he like?

463
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:24.203
He's just a guy who lives an upright life.

464
00:29:25.572 --> 00:29:29.102
He's hardworking, honest, and a law-abiding citizen.

465
00:29:29.703 --> 00:29:32.272
The truth is, he's totally my dream guy.

466
00:29:33.213 --> 00:29:35.582
I see. A law-abiding citizen. Okay.

467
00:29:46.393 --> 00:29:47.663
Aren't you eating?

468
00:29:51.233 --> 00:29:53.133
Hello, everyone.

469
00:29:54.903 --> 00:29:56.772
I guess we're working late again tonight.

470
00:29:56.832 --> 00:29:58.133
Are there always this many?

471
00:29:59.233 --> 00:30:01.502
It's not bad because we're not cracking down.

472
00:30:01.703 --> 00:30:04.143
It's worse during vacation seasons and in December.

473
00:30:04.973 --> 00:30:08.242
The police can catch 1,000 a day if they wanted.

474
00:30:08.242 --> 00:30:10.613
- That many? - You're back again?

475
00:30:14.022 --> 00:30:16.423
Ms. Son. What's wrong?

476
00:30:24.693 --> 00:30:25.762
Mi Young.

477
00:30:40.113 --> 00:30:45.082
(OBGYN)

478
00:30:45.582 --> 00:30:47.623
The STD spread to the pelvis.

479
00:30:47.623 --> 00:30:49.022
That caused the miscarriage.

480
00:30:50.092 --> 00:30:52.893
We gave her two bags of blood during surgery.

481
00:30:53.163 --> 00:30:56.062
That's the level of pernicious anemia.

482
00:30:56.733 --> 00:30:58.463
Even if they don't care about her,

483
00:30:58.463 --> 00:31:00.802
how could they not know until she got this bad?

484
00:31:02.502 --> 00:31:04.102
Bring her guardian.

485
00:31:15.126 --> 00:31:18.358

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

486
00:31:29.092 --> 00:31:31.163
She started working...

487
00:31:31.893 --> 00:31:35.663
when she was 15 to save her old grandma.

488
00:31:37.072 --> 00:31:39.903
She never bought anything she wanted...

489
00:31:39.903 --> 00:31:41.602
to eat or wear,

490
00:31:42.342 --> 00:31:44.913
and spent all her money on my hospital bills.

491
00:31:45.312 --> 00:31:46.512
All of it.

492
00:31:47.842 --> 00:31:49.913
That's why I'm too ashamed...

493
00:31:50.213 --> 00:31:52.713
to see her dad.

494
00:31:53.782 --> 00:31:56.822
Still, her new boss now...

495
00:31:57.052 --> 00:31:59.623
must really like her.

496
00:31:59.762 --> 00:32:02.592
He pays her so much more.

497
00:32:03.792 --> 00:32:05.092
That's why...

498
00:32:05.262 --> 00:32:07.963
I feel a little bit better.

499
00:32:09.903 --> 00:32:12.903
But that doesn't take away...

500
00:32:12.903 --> 00:32:14.903
my feelings of guilt.

501
00:32:18.113 --> 00:32:19.272
Granny.

502
00:32:19.673 --> 00:32:21.312
Soo Ah...

503
00:32:24.512 --> 00:32:25.852
Just a minute.

504
00:32:27.183 --> 00:32:28.282
Yes?

505
00:32:28.552 --> 00:32:30.453
Yes, yes. My little puppy.

506
00:32:32.322 --> 00:32:33.463
What?

507
00:32:34.863 --> 00:32:37.492
She wants to talk to you.

508
00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:45.233
- Hello? - I'll talk.

509
00:32:45.873 --> 00:32:48.572
- About what? - About my boss.

510
00:32:48.973 --> 00:32:51.842
So don't tell my grandma anything and come back.

511
00:32:52.742 --> 00:32:56.042
If you're not here in 10, I won't talk.

512
00:32:59.822 --> 00:33:02.723
Shoot. Let's go for now.

513
00:33:05.492 --> 00:33:08.062
Did something happen to her?

514
00:33:08.562 --> 00:33:11.292
I was trying to scold those young chicks...

515
00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:14.133
who were trying to make money easily.

516
00:33:14.463 --> 00:33:16.802
I was dragged here unjustly.

517
00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:18.373
I see.

518
00:33:19.032 --> 00:33:21.772
But why did you take off your clothes?

519
00:33:22.473 --> 00:33:24.913
- I was hot. - Is it summer?

520
00:33:26.483 --> 00:33:29.413
It's no fun doing it with my wife.

521
00:33:30.183 --> 00:33:31.613
There's no feeling.

522
00:33:32.613 --> 00:33:35.552
I wonder if it's right to do that with family.

523
00:33:36.992 --> 00:33:39.552
You must know how I feel, right?

524
00:33:40.163 --> 00:33:41.923
I'll ask the questions.

525
00:33:42.163 --> 00:33:43.163
Fine.

526
00:33:44.562 --> 00:33:46.903
You know how it is, right?

527
00:33:47.562 --> 00:33:49.502
Sometimes, you don't want to eat at home.

528
00:33:50.002 --> 00:33:51.802
You want to eat out once in a while.

529
00:33:52.633 --> 00:33:53.842
It's nice.

530
00:33:54.742 --> 00:33:57.973
Also, prison food is good for you.

531
00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:02.082
You get to eat out all you want now,

532
00:34:03.252 --> 00:34:04.582
in prison.

533
00:34:07.082 --> 00:34:08.852
Someone I know well...

534
00:34:13.463 --> 00:34:20.162
(Criminal Record, Lee Dong Shin)

535
00:34:31.772 --> 00:34:33.243
This is insane.

536
00:34:34.182 --> 00:34:36.582
You're not done yet. Wait out in the hall.

537
00:34:36.613 --> 00:34:37.653
Okay.

538
00:34:38.412 --> 00:34:39.883
- Here... - On the desk.

539
00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:43.823
Gosh.

540
00:34:48.022 --> 00:34:50.033
He puts the others to shame.

541
00:34:50.932 --> 00:34:51.993
I know, right?

542
00:34:52.162 --> 00:34:54.303
Shouldn't he be isolated by now?

543
00:34:54.702 --> 00:34:56.202
I agree. He should be.

544
00:35:05.513 --> 00:35:06.582
Mi Young.

545
00:35:11.113 --> 00:35:12.912
Come on, Mi Young.

546
00:35:13.582 --> 00:35:14.682
What's wrong with you?

547
00:35:15.923 --> 00:35:17.892
Why is our nice Mi Young being like this?

548
00:35:18.593 --> 00:35:19.722
What was that?

549
00:35:20.493 --> 00:35:22.323
With your experience,

550
00:35:22.323 --> 00:35:24.162
you can talk to the prosecutor...

551
00:35:24.392 --> 00:35:26.392
and get me off with a fine.

552
00:35:27.332 --> 00:35:29.932
Don't be like that. Let's redo the questioning.

553
00:35:30.272 --> 00:35:31.573
Let's cancel the previous one.

554
00:35:31.972 --> 00:35:33.772
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

555
00:35:34.872 --> 00:35:36.142
Shoot.

556
00:35:37.642 --> 00:35:39.312
You can't just go.

557
00:35:40.312 --> 00:35:42.943
I'm trying to save an old hag who can't get married.

558
00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.783
You can't do this to me.

559
00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:48.553
- What? - You rat.

560
00:35:48.852 --> 00:35:49.923
Who are you?

561
00:35:51.122 --> 00:35:52.993
You're being too harsh...

562
00:35:54.562 --> 00:35:55.693
Mr. Koo!

563
00:35:59.662 --> 00:36:00.763
Hey.

564
00:36:00.803 --> 00:36:04.133
You disgusting good-for-nothing rat.

565
00:36:04.573 --> 00:36:07.972
You're grosser than a moldy slice of bread.

566
00:36:08.403 --> 00:36:12.272
How dare you run your foul little mouth?

567
00:36:12.743 --> 00:36:15.182
Do you need to peel chestnuts in Siberia...

568
00:36:15.182 --> 00:36:18.513
and poop blood in prison...

569
00:36:18.513 --> 00:36:21.283
to learn your lesson?

570
00:36:29.693 --> 00:36:31.993
Okay. I got it.

571
00:36:34.963 --> 00:36:37.002
Poop blood? Blood?

572
00:36:41.943 --> 00:36:43.213
Are you okay?

573
00:36:43.642 --> 00:36:44.912
Are you okay?

574
00:36:45.113 --> 00:36:46.783
You shouldn't worry about me right now.

575
00:36:46.783 --> 00:36:48.682
You're too nice for your own good.

576
00:36:50.952 --> 00:36:52.783
That jerk.

577
00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:57.423
When did you learn to curse like that?

578
00:36:58.193 --> 00:37:00.622
I memorized it with friends when I was young.

579
00:37:00.863 --> 00:37:02.062
I finally got to use it.

580
00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:04.593
How fun.

581
00:37:05.693 --> 00:37:06.702
Let's go.

582
00:37:08.602 --> 00:37:11.372
As Cho Gap Soo's ratings...

583
00:37:11.372 --> 00:37:12.903
have shot up,

584
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:15.472
the difference between him and Kim Moon Sung,

585
00:37:15.472 --> 00:37:17.513
whose ratings dropped, is 15 percent.

586
00:37:17.713 --> 00:37:20.013
Notwithstanding a huge variable,

587
00:37:20.013 --> 00:37:21.812
Cho Gap Soo will...

588
00:37:22.082 --> 00:37:25.653
very likely become the next Mayor of Yeongpa.

589
00:37:26.582 --> 00:37:27.752
Sang Ho.

590
00:37:28.483 --> 00:37:30.752
It's been a while. Should you and I...

591
00:37:31.252 --> 00:37:32.892
go there?

592
00:37:33.392 --> 00:37:34.493
Pardon?

593
00:37:45.573 --> 00:37:49.073
I came here and cried twice.

594
00:37:50.173 --> 00:37:53.443
Do you know when the first time was?

595
00:37:55.383 --> 00:37:56.952
Wasn't it when the prosecutor's office...

596
00:37:57.153 --> 00:37:58.613
rejected you after you passed the bar...

597
00:37:58.613 --> 00:38:00.452
because of your father's record?

598
00:38:00.452 --> 00:38:01.553
That's right.

599
00:38:02.752 --> 00:38:04.053
Gosh.

600
00:38:04.053 --> 00:38:06.622
It was raining that winter,

601
00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:08.493
and I failed.

602
00:38:09.093 --> 00:38:11.432
My future seemed bleak.

603
00:38:12.292 --> 00:38:14.202
The tears just fell on their own.

604
00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:18.573
That's when I realized...

605
00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:21.903
how salty my tears were.

606
00:38:25.642 --> 00:38:26.812
Do you know...

607
00:38:27.412 --> 00:38:28.783
when the other time was?

608
00:38:32.312 --> 00:38:33.883
It was...

609
00:38:34.122 --> 00:38:37.593
when you went to jail in my place.

610
00:38:38.292 --> 00:38:39.292
I came...

611
00:38:39.923 --> 00:38:41.493
by myself...

612
00:38:42.162 --> 00:38:44.193
and cried buckets.

613
00:38:52.102 --> 00:38:53.243
Sang Ho.

614
00:38:55.173 --> 00:38:56.343
I couldn't...

615
00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:58.573
have gotten here if not for you.

616
00:38:59.812 --> 00:39:02.042
Why are you saying something so ridiculous?

617
00:39:07.823 --> 00:39:10.153
You'll stay by my side...

618
00:39:10.653 --> 00:39:11.653
until I go...

619
00:39:12.653 --> 00:39:14.792
to the Blue House, won't you?

620
00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:18.033
I'll serve you with all my heart.

621
00:39:23.173 --> 00:39:26.743
When did Min Ho say he was coming?

622
00:39:35.713 --> 00:39:37.252
He's a new attorney.

623
00:39:37.252 --> 00:39:38.852
Mr. Baek's brother.

624
00:39:39.182 --> 00:39:40.722
Hello. I'm Baek Min Ho.

625
00:39:41.222 --> 00:39:42.323
We met before.

626
00:39:47.263 --> 00:39:50.463
Why are you working below me?

627
00:39:51.093 --> 00:39:52.162
I have to assist someone.

628
00:39:52.162 --> 00:39:54.832
Might as well be a successful attorney.

629
00:39:55.303 --> 00:39:56.633
My brother says...

630
00:39:56.832 --> 00:39:59.432
you're the ace here.

631
00:39:59.702 --> 00:40:02.303
I hope to learn a lot from you.

632
00:40:08.883 --> 00:40:10.752
There they come.

633
00:40:10.883 --> 00:40:12.213
How's Kong Soo Ah?

634
00:40:12.213 --> 00:40:14.423
- She needed surgery? - Yes.

635
00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:15.983
I'll go see her first.

636
00:40:15.983 --> 00:40:17.093
Fill them in.

637
00:40:18.193 --> 00:40:19.923
Let's talk over there.

638
00:40:20.923 --> 00:40:23.763
Yes. That's right. Gosh.

639
00:40:23.763 --> 00:40:26.502
You know, I am so blessed...

640
00:40:26.502 --> 00:40:29.432
because of my baby. Gosh.

641
00:40:29.562 --> 00:40:30.633
Why?

642
00:40:30.633 --> 00:40:32.533
Those people earlier...

643
00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:35.173
cleaned my house nice and clean,

644
00:40:35.173 --> 00:40:37.412
and replaced the ceiling light...

645
00:40:37.412 --> 00:40:39.213
that had been flickering.

646
00:40:39.213 --> 00:40:42.812
Gosh. They told me to feed my baby good food,

647
00:40:42.812 --> 00:40:45.483
and even left me money.

648
00:40:46.582 --> 00:40:49.022
What the... Why are they such busybodies?

649
00:40:49.022 --> 00:40:52.423
Because my little puppy doesn't do bad things...

650
00:40:52.423 --> 00:40:54.593
and is such a good person,

651
00:40:54.593 --> 00:40:59.162
the man upstairs was impressed...

652
00:40:59.162 --> 00:41:04.133
and sent such great people into your life.

653
00:41:04.133 --> 00:41:05.202
Don't you agree?

654
00:41:07.502 --> 00:41:08.602
Bye, Grandma.

655
00:41:10.613 --> 00:41:12.412
Hey you. Kiddo.

656
00:41:13.283 --> 00:41:15.483
I saw you sitting up and talking on the phone.

657
00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.153
What is it?

658
00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:20.783
Keep your promise.

659
00:41:20.783 --> 00:41:22.722
You said you'd tell me everything about Jang Ho.

660
00:41:22.722 --> 00:41:23.722
So?

661
00:41:24.093 --> 00:41:25.352
Did you clean the house...

662
00:41:25.352 --> 00:41:26.823
and leave money in case I don't talk?

663
00:41:27.522 --> 00:41:28.863
Good.

664
00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:31.062
Then I should keep quiet.

665
00:41:32.662 --> 00:41:35.062
What else will you do for me then?

666
00:41:37.533 --> 00:41:39.303
I've been controlling my temper...

667
00:41:39.303 --> 00:41:41.602
because you're a sick minor,

668
00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:44.472
but you did this to yourself.

669
00:41:45.573 --> 00:41:47.182
I'll go to your grandma...

670
00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:49.582
and tell her you've been selling yourself.

671
00:41:49.582 --> 00:41:52.653
Seriously. Don't touch my grandma.

672
00:41:52.752 --> 00:41:54.383
She'll faint.

673
00:41:54.383 --> 00:41:55.622
Of course.

674
00:41:55.622 --> 00:41:56.722
I'm a stranger,

675
00:41:56.722 --> 00:41:58.952
and I'm about to faint from the shock.

676
00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:00.323
Imagine if your grandma finds out.

677
00:42:00.323 --> 00:42:01.722
She'll die on the spot.

678
00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:04.392
Who are you to act all high and mighty?

679
00:42:05.093 --> 00:42:07.633
- What? - You never lost a parent.

680
00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:10.472
You were never picked on for being a poor orphan.

681
00:42:10.733 --> 00:42:12.633
Not being able to say you're sick...

682
00:42:12.633 --> 00:42:13.903
or tired.

683
00:42:15.772 --> 00:42:17.272
Do you even know what it's like...

684
00:42:17.272 --> 00:42:18.573
not to have parents?

685
00:42:20.213 --> 00:42:21.283
To me,

686
00:42:23.013 --> 00:42:24.653
my grandma is my mom...

687
00:42:24.912 --> 00:42:26.082
and my all.

688
00:42:27.823 --> 00:42:29.383
I'll die without my grandma.

689
00:42:34.193 --> 00:42:35.522
That's your problem.

690
00:42:36.432 --> 00:42:38.533
If you won't cooperate, I'll have no choice.

691
00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:39.932
I can't let a human trafficker...

692
00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.403
who traffics minors go just because...

693
00:42:41.403 --> 00:42:42.803
I feel sorry for you.

694
00:42:43.403 --> 00:42:44.803
So tell me.

695
00:42:59.283 --> 00:43:01.952
He's saved in there as "Chicken Place Boss".

696
00:43:02.423 --> 00:43:03.993
I don't know anything else.

697
00:43:04.093 --> 00:43:05.892
I only see him briefly when I get paid.

698
00:43:06.662 --> 00:43:08.392
That's more like it.

700
00:43:43.263 --> 00:43:45.263
You never lost a parent.

701
00:43:46.432 --> 00:43:47.562
This is my mom.

702
00:43:47.562 --> 00:43:48.562
This is my mom.

703
00:43:48.562 --> 00:43:50.602
If you see her, please...

704
00:43:51.403 --> 00:43:52.403
Excuse me.

Please dig into this number.

707
00:44:11.053 --> 00:44:12.193
It's a burner,

708
00:44:12.193 --> 00:44:13.193
so he'll submerge...

709
00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:14.763
if the finds out we're onto him.

710
00:44:14.763 --> 00:44:17.832
Mr. Seo. Soo Ah is the only lead so far.

711
00:44:17.832 --> 00:44:19.392
Wouldn't it be better to use her as bait...

712
00:44:19.392 --> 00:44:21.002
to catch him?

713
00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:23.972
No, we can't do that.

714
00:44:24.073 --> 00:44:25.673
She needs time to recover.

715
00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:27.803
Don't be too forceful when questioning her.

716
00:44:27.803 --> 00:44:29.303
Trace this number first,

717
00:44:29.303 --> 00:44:31.613
and let's decide as things progress.

718
00:44:35.142 --> 00:44:37.013
Get a new phone already.

719
00:44:41.952 --> 00:44:42.952
Please...

720
00:44:43.153 --> 00:44:45.252
find me her address.

721
00:44:52.093 --> 00:44:53.263
They're extras.

722
00:44:53.263 --> 00:44:54.863
I have a lot of socks at home.

723
00:44:57.073 --> 00:44:58.533
Plus, I've met a lot...

724
00:44:58.533 --> 00:45:00.542
of kids like you during my years as a prosecutor,

725
00:45:00.972 --> 00:45:02.243
but I never met an idiot...

726
00:45:02.243 --> 00:45:04.213
who doesn't look out for her own health.

727
00:45:04.613 --> 00:45:05.613
Whatever.

728
00:45:05.872 --> 00:45:07.312
At least wear socks.

729
00:45:07.312 --> 00:45:09.483
Why are you barefoot? You look poor.

730
00:45:12.352 --> 00:45:13.722
How tacky.

731
00:45:14.522 --> 00:45:16.593
Who wear long socks anymore?

732
00:45:17.022 --> 00:45:18.952
Then give them to your grandma.

733
00:45:18.952 --> 00:45:20.993
I noticed she had holes in her socks.

734
00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:28.702
Call me if you want to talk more about Eel.

735
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:29.932
Got it?

736
00:45:30.972 --> 00:45:32.002
I'll see.

737
00:45:32.533 --> 00:45:33.702
You brat.

738
00:45:34.042 --> 00:45:35.443
Later, kid.

739

Ms. Ma.

740
00:45:52.323 --> 00:45:53.323
Did they catch him?

741
00:45:53.323 --> 00:45:55.193
- That's not it. - Hold on.

742
00:45:57.392 --> 00:45:58.463
Hello?

743
00:46:01.233 --> 00:46:02.903
Okay. I'll come now.

744
00:46:03.633 --> 00:46:05.872
I have to rush somewhere.

745
00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:07.042

748
00:47:13.772 --> 00:47:15.772
Mr. Koo. I'll send you a government ID number.

749
00:47:15.772 --> 00:47:17.073
Please run an identity check.

750
00:47:21.682 --> 00:47:22.783
I will drive you home.

751
00:47:24.752 --> 00:47:26.553
It's a happy day.

752
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:29.182
Shouldn't we pop some champagne?

753
00:47:30.153 --> 00:47:31.522
I'll take you to the kingdom.

754
00:47:32.792 --> 00:47:35.522
Call those old men from back then.

755
00:47:35.792 --> 00:47:36.792
Yes, sir.

756
00:47:44.872 --> 00:47:46.233
Okay.

762
00:48:22.372 --> 00:48:24.513
You need to monitor him better.

763
00:48:25.113 --> 00:48:26.943
- Okay? - I'm sorry.

764
00:48:27.483 --> 00:48:28.582
Uncle.

765

You're hurting my feelings.

766

If I ever see you here again,

772

I won't care that you're my nephew.

773

You will die that very day.

Got it?

775
00:49:36.312 --> 00:49:38.383
Who is he to tell me where to go?

776
00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:43.553
He's nothing but a leech living off my aunt.

777
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:56.303
So? Where do you plan to go?

778

Here.

779
00:50:02.202 --> 00:50:04.613
Read these and summarize them by morning.

781
00:50:08.082 --> 00:50:09.343
Will you be okay?

782
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:13.483
Your uncle will flip out if he finds out.

783

Okay, I'll go now.

784

Yes?

I'm sorry.

I didn't want to, but I had no choice.

794

It's okay. We're friends after all.

795

In exchange, let's do a job.

796
00:51:34.863 --> 00:51:36.102
I'm sorry,

797
00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:38.573
but I'm not feeling well.

You're not well? How?

799
00:51:41.843 --> 00:51:43.312
I had surgery today.

800
00:51:43.513 --> 00:51:47.082
You should've told me if you had surgery.

801

So? Did you die?

802

No.

Do it well. Show some loyalty.

If this goes well, you'll get one large.

your mom was an important informant for a case.

My mom?

821
00:54:40.952 --> 00:54:43.022
You were too young back then,

822
00:54:43.923 --> 00:54:46.562
and I thought it was meaningless to tell you,

823
00:54:47.493 --> 00:54:49.392
but I felt like I should tell you now.

824

I looked, and that ID says it's Jung Gap Soon.

Yes, I ate.

00:58:33.923 --> 00:58:36.792
I searched the ID number on her chart,

851
00:58:36.892 --> 00:58:38.292
and it was someone else.

852
00:58:38.423 --> 00:58:40.162
Her name and address are all different too.

853
00:58:43.963 --> 00:58:44.993
Really?

854
00:58:47.102 --> 00:58:48.133
Don't you...

855
00:58:49.502 --> 00:58:50.932
have something to say to me?

856
00:59:05.013 --> 00:59:06.013
Ma?
