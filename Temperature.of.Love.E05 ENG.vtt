00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.182
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:21.961
I'll...

3
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:25.202
go now.

4
00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:16.612
Please stop crying.

5
00:01:16.612 --> 00:01:21.692
It'd be great if I could stop crying just because you tell me to.

6
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.121
- You're here. - Hey. Why is she crying?

7
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:25.862
Her ex-boyfriend's getting married.

8
00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:27.115
Don't tell her that.

9
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.561
She's going to look down on me now.

10
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:29.791
Gosh, your hands are dirty.

11
00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:31.461
How did you find out that he's getting married?

12
00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.632
See? She's just interested in knowing about the facts.

13
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:38.541
I need to know the facts before I take any kind of action.

14
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.112
Good for you. Not everyone's coolheaded like you.

15
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.511
How does she expect to become a screenwriter?

16
00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:47.311
She can't write romance. At least she's going for dramas with a genre.

17
00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:49.479
You guys are a great match.

18
00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:50.722
Why don't you date each other?

19
00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:52.052
- No! - No!

20
00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:56.151
We're practically brothers.

21
00:01:56.692 --> 00:01:58.392
We're sisters, not brothers.

22
00:01:58.392 --> 00:01:59.692
What are you saying?

23
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:02.061
You guys become happy so quickly.

24
00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:04.102
Where are you coming from?

25
00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:08.071
Back then, I didn't know...

26
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:10.171
it was love.

27
00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:13.472
Why is it hard...

28
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.081
for us to be sure that we're in love?

29
00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:23.282
Hey.

30
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:24.722
Are you okay?

31
00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:28.791
I'm going to die.

32
00:02:29.692 --> 00:02:30.761
Stop it already.

33
00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:35.162
I hope you cry your eyes out because of a guy...

34
00:02:35.162 --> 00:02:37.731
and end up devastated all by yourself.

35
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:39.231
You should wish for something more realistic.

36
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:40.902
That will never happen to her.

37
00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:44.102
Hyun Soo thinks of love as a neatly ironed dress shirt.

38
00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:55.011
(Temperature of Love)

39
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.741
Excuse me.

40
00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:23.011
Me?

41
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:24.481
Yes.

42
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.382
Are you here to see my son?

43
00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.352
Who's your son?

44
00:03:37.222 --> 00:03:38.321
Welcome.

45
00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:41.991
I'd like to get a cellphone.

46
00:03:41.991 --> 00:03:43.432
Is there a specific model you want?

47
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:51.301
Kenya Double A.

48
00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:54.472
- Pardon? - It is.

49
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:58.741
You know that?

50
00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:02.212
How do you know Jung Sun? I know all his friends.

51
00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:05.652
We just met.

52
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.451
We met through a running club.

53
00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:09.451
How old are you?

54
00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:11.962
I'm 29.

55
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:13.731
29...

56
00:04:15.092 --> 00:04:16.631
Then you're older than my son.

57
00:04:19.602 --> 00:04:21.032
I feel relieved all of a sudden.

58
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.072
It was nice meeting you.

59
00:04:30.212 --> 00:04:33.782
I keep a long relationship with people.

60
00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:38.222
But I'm disappointed that this one won't last long.

61
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:54.572
Goodness.

62
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:09.712
Hello?

63
00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:11.551
This is Park Jung Woo.

64
00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:14.092
Pardon?

65
00:05:14.322 --> 00:05:15.551
Don't you remember me?

66
00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:18.822
I'm Joon Ha's school senior and yours too.

67
00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:23.231
Right. Hello.

68
00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:25.262
How did you get my number?

69
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:27.602
I thought you were smart,

70
00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:29.832
but the quality of your question is quite low.

71
00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:34.012
I'm feeling terrible today.

72
00:05:34.012 --> 00:05:37.642
I received a complaint about you today.

73
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:39.342
You mean from Joon Ho.

74
00:05:39.582 --> 00:05:40.912
I heard you were fired.

75
00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:42.751
Gosh, that jerk...

76
00:05:45.322 --> 00:05:47.222
Come to my office by 5pm.

77
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:48.551
I don't want to.

78
00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:50.392
If you don't, I'll remember you...

79
00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.822
as someone with an inferiority complex.

80
00:05:53.022 --> 00:05:55.061
I don't care what you remember me as.

81
00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:01.931
Gosh, Kim Joon Ha. My gosh.

82
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:24.592
Hey.

83
00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:26.322
Hey.

84
00:06:27.691 --> 00:06:30.462
What are you doing? I told you to cook sous vide when it's a puree.

85
00:06:30.462 --> 00:06:32.532
These potatoes have a lot of moisture.

86
00:06:32.532 --> 00:06:34.402
It's better to bake them and lessen...

87
00:06:34.402 --> 00:06:37.041
Again! You're not listening.

88
00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:39.301
Last time I cooked it sous vide.

89
00:06:39.572 --> 00:06:42.512
I see. Is that why you're undermining me?

90
00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:45.741
I'm telling you that I respect what you said.

91
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.111
Last time I cooked sous vide because they were dry.

92
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:51.681
You're saying potatoes need to be cooked differently,

93
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:53.352
but I don't know that.

94
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:56.861
That's right.

95
00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:00.191
"That's right"?

96
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.262
"That's right"? Why you...

97
00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:05.301
What are you doing?

98
00:07:16.272 --> 00:07:17.282
Hey.

99
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:19.741
Hey, where are you going?

100
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:21.611
Go easy on him.

101
00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:24.082
If I do, they'll get lazy and make a mess.

102
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:27.322
What are you doing? It's almost serving time.

103
00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.491
Did you not hear me?

104
00:07:29.722 --> 00:07:31.621
Why did you change the subject? Why did you cut me off?

105
00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.131
I'm sorry, sir.

106
00:07:42.572 --> 00:07:44.001
Are you really going to act like this?

107
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:46.072
I told you before.

108
00:07:46.072 --> 00:07:48.412
Getting along well with your team is also a skill.

109
00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:51.811
Does getting along well mean holding back?

110
00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:55.082
Even if you're talented you're still a rookie.

111
00:07:55.082 --> 00:07:57.251
You can't get settled here without my help.

112
00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.421
Get to work when the sous chef comes to work.

113
00:08:01.592 --> 00:08:02.592
Assist him.

114
00:08:03.722 --> 00:08:04.722
Jung Sun.

115
00:08:05.092 --> 00:08:07.491
You know you're my favorite.

116
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:09.592
I'm doing this for your sake.

117
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:12.061
I...

118
00:08:12.662 --> 00:08:15.702
thought holding back until you told me to assist the sous chef...

119
00:08:16.472 --> 00:08:19.602
was the way to repay your kindness.

120
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:20.912
But?

121
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:23.072
I changed my mind when you said, "I'm doing this for your sake."

122
00:08:23.642 --> 00:08:26.111
One thing that I learned is that when someone forces you...

123
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.912
to do something and tells you that it's for your sake, it's a scam.

124
00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:33.121
I'll think about it.

125
00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:37.021
Whether staying here is really good for my sake.

126
00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:40.021
Because I know what's best for me.

127
00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:53.511
Are you okay?

128
00:08:53.812 --> 00:08:55.011
Yes.

129
00:08:56.271 --> 00:08:57.342
Bye, then.

130
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.312
- Please follow me. - Okay.

131
00:09:12.322 --> 00:09:13.631
Jung Sun is in, right?

132
00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:16.332
Yes.

133
00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:17.932
Tell him his mom is here.

134
00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:53.631
What are you doing, my daughter?

135
00:09:56.172 --> 00:09:58.271
I have a mom too!

136
00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:01.812
Is something wrong?

137
00:10:02.712 --> 00:10:03.741
No.

138
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.952
I met my friend's mom, and I missed you.

139
00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:11.521
Shall we hug?

140
00:10:12.052 --> 00:10:13.052
Sounds good!

141
00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:23.562
I'm good now.

142
00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:27.131
- Are you happy now? - Yes.

143
00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:31.072
I'm fully charged. I'll go home now.

144
00:10:31.572 --> 00:10:32.641
Hey.

145
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:34.411
Aren't you going to tell me what's wrong?

146
00:10:37.442 --> 00:10:38.481
Mom.

147
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:40.852
Am I talented?

148
00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:42.712
Of course you are.

149
00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:44.722
You're talented at everything.

150
00:10:47.192 --> 00:10:48.452
You say that because you're my mom.

151
00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:50.822
That makes me feel better.

152
00:10:51.562 --> 00:10:54.861
Work is important, but you should marry well.

153
00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:57.231
Your dad and I only look at one thing.

154
00:10:57.462 --> 00:11:01.102
His upbringing. A man who grew up in a happy family.

155
00:11:01.102 --> 00:11:03.401
Stop it. You said it too many times.

156
00:11:06.342 --> 00:11:07.371
It's your dad.

157
00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:10.611
(My Darling)

158
00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:13.651
Today's lunch. What about you?

159
00:11:14.182 --> 00:11:16.082
- Are you that happy? - Of course.

160
00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:21.452
Hyun Soo is here. I had lunch.

161
00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:22.751
(Hyun Soo is here. I had lunch.)

162
00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:25.521
Did you have lunch already?

163
00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:29.361
I love how you and Dad put yourselves before children.

164
00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:31.531
So I only need to worry about myself.

165
00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:35.631
We love each other so much, so we wouldn't burden you.

166
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:52.981
Did you cook this? It's perfectly cooked.

167
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.021
Why do you think I came here?

168
00:12:00.231 --> 00:12:02.562
I don't want you to hate me for what happened this morning.

169
00:12:05.062 --> 00:12:08.802
You know how I apologize and reflect on myself well.

170
00:12:10.602 --> 00:12:11.602
Enjoy your meal.

171
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:14.241
Can you stay until I finish?

172
00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:24.952
It's 60 dollars.

173
00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:27.692
Put it on my son's tab, please.

174
00:12:28.552 --> 00:12:30.192
That's going to be difficult.

175
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:34.991
Okay. Did you enjoy your meal?

176
00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:36.391
Yes.

177
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:50.881
Thank you.

178
00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:04.137

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

179
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.901
I know how to make meringue as well.

180
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:19.371
You enter this kitchen like it's yours.

181
00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:22.842
I have a passport that allows me to enter anywhere.

182
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:26.442
It seems like being corny is your trademark now.

183
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:27.611
It suits you.

184
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:29.381
I don't know if I should take that as a criticism or a compliment.

185
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:31.722
I'll just take it as a compliment.

186
00:13:33.991 --> 00:13:36.322
Okay, let me get straight to the point.

187
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.991
Have you thought about the offer I made to you last time?

188
00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:42.792
What offer?

189
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:45.332
I said I'll invest in opening your own restaurant.

190
00:13:45.432 --> 00:13:48.602
I took it lightly, so I didn't know you were being serious.

191
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:56.172
I thought you didn't have a cell phone, but I guess you do.

192
00:13:56.241 --> 00:13:57.712
I bought it today.

193
00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:58.712
(Jarvis Body Wear is on sale.)

194
00:14:00.682 --> 00:14:01.682
Let me see.

195
00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:07.722
Save this number.

196
00:14:09.121 --> 00:14:11.121
- Am I your first contact number? - No.

197
00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:13.222
I'd like to make an official offer.

198
00:14:13.222 --> 00:14:14.731
I'd like to officially refuse that offer.

199
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:17.001
My gosh, you should at least think about it before you refuse.

200
00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:18.761
I already thought about it enough.

201
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:20.631
That's why I can answer so quickly.

202
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:22.771
Thank you for the kind offer though.

203
00:14:24.202 --> 00:14:26.472
If I want something, I keep on trying.

204
00:14:27.712 --> 00:14:28.911
Then I make it mine.

205
00:14:31.942 --> 00:14:33.342
This is just the beginning.

206
00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:43.352
Rice is the best.

207
00:14:54.131 --> 00:14:55.271
(Missed call)

208
00:14:57.072 --> 00:14:58.072
Who's this?

209
00:14:59.842 --> 00:15:01.241
I think I've seen this number before.

210
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:05.241
It's me, Jung Sun.

211
00:15:07.952 --> 00:15:09.312
He called me.

212
00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:10.852
Why did he call?

213
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:13.751
I can't believe I missed it.

214
00:15:13.922 --> 00:15:17.692
He called me at 8:43am. That's when I was in front of his house.

215
00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:20.161
Why did he call?

216
00:15:23.462 --> 00:15:25.702
I can't even call him back because it's a pay phone.

217
00:15:29.972 --> 00:15:32.102
But then again, why not? It doesn't hurt to try.

218
00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:51.121
Hello? This is Earth.

219
00:15:51.462 --> 00:15:52.861
My gosh. What's he saying?

220
00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:57.161
May I ask the location of the pay phone?

221
00:15:57.161 --> 00:16:00.672
It's located at the entrance of Yeonnam Park.

222
00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:02.472
Okay, thank you.

223
00:16:23.222 --> 00:16:24.592
(Unknown Number)

224
00:16:25.722 --> 00:16:26.792
Hello?

225
00:16:27.231 --> 00:16:28.261
Hello?

226
00:16:31.501 --> 00:16:32.602
Hello?

227
00:16:33.062 --> 00:16:34.271
I bought a cell phone.

228
00:16:38.802 --> 00:16:40.001
I see.

229
00:16:41.212 --> 00:16:43.342
Are you sick? What's wrong with your voice?

230
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:45.511
No, I'm not sick.

231
00:16:46.082 --> 00:16:49.111
I'm just happy to hear... No. I'm excited... No.

232
00:16:52.852 --> 00:16:53.991
Never mind.

233
00:16:54.092 --> 00:16:55.391
I'm glad you're not sick.

234
00:16:56.151 --> 00:16:57.962
I have to go back inside to prepare the ingredients for dinner time.

235
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:00.631
I also have to hang up to go to an appointment.

236
00:17:09.072 --> 00:17:11.072
(On Jung Sun)

237
00:17:14.312 --> 00:17:16.211
I've never felt this way before.

238
00:17:22.381 --> 00:17:23.651
Is it someone's birthday today?

239
00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:26.181
Is this all for lunch?

240
00:17:26.352 --> 00:17:28.022
I'm going to share some with the nurses.

241
00:17:29.092 --> 00:17:30.121
What's this?

242
00:17:30.121 --> 00:17:33.191
Fried eels. Ganghwa Island is famous for eels.

243
00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:36.532
- It's delicious. - Really?

244
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:39.201
Are you that happy to see me eat?

245
00:17:39.262 --> 00:17:42.371
It makes me happy to see someone enjoy something I cooked,

246
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:43.641
even if that's not you.

247
00:17:44.242 --> 00:17:46.542
Are you still dreaming about becoming a chef?

248
00:17:46.772 --> 00:17:49.842
It's such a waste to quit your job as a doctor just to become a chef.

249
00:17:49.842 --> 00:17:51.181
Why is that a waste?

250
00:17:51.411 --> 00:17:53.111
Do you think you'll be able to go against your parents?

251
00:17:53.211 --> 00:17:55.782
Only people who come from a poor background like Jung Sun...

252
00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:57.782
are able to chase their dreams to become whatever they want.

253
00:17:57.782 --> 00:17:59.352
Why do you think he comes from a poor family?

254
00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:01.921
His dad's a doctor, and his grandfather's a rich man in Andong.

255
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:03.992
It seemed like he even got some inheritance from his grandfather.

256
00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:05.792
Then why can't he ask me out?

257
00:18:06.022 --> 00:18:07.792
I thought it was because he lacked confidence.

258
00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.391
Being delusional is also an illness, you know.

259
00:18:10.062 --> 00:18:12.502
Not all men tend to be attracted to women like you.

260
00:18:13.131 --> 00:18:14.201
Hey.

261
00:18:14.201 --> 00:18:15.732
I think you're suffering from lack of affection.

262
00:18:15.832 --> 00:18:18.802
I think you're the one who's delusional.

263
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.871
Do you want to bet if Jung Sun really likes me or not?

264
00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:23.881
Let's see if he falls for me or not.

265
00:18:23.881 --> 00:18:25.641
I don't bet on people.

266
00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:27.482
Eat up.

267
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.181
How do you expect me to eat after making me angry?

268
00:18:29.582 --> 00:18:31.022
I'm never going to see you again.

269
00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:33.752
You should know who you're talking to. I'm Ji Hong Ah.

270
00:18:46.832 --> 00:18:49.002
(Park Soo Bin, 17 years old, Knows how to sing and dance)

271
00:18:53.772 --> 00:18:56.111
Mr. Park, Ms. Lee Hyun Soo is here.

272
00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:05.852
You're very punctual. I thought all writers tend to be late.

273
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.262
I'm not a writer yet, and I like being punctual.

274
00:19:11.121 --> 00:19:13.262
Do you need a license to become a writer?

275
00:19:13.532 --> 00:19:15.762
You write for a living. Doesn't that mean you're a writer?

276
00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:18.332
If you're abroad, you just need to write one book to become a writer.

277
00:19:21.002 --> 00:19:23.072
You need to have a free mind to become a writer.

278
00:19:24.742 --> 00:19:27.441
I haven't been able to free myself from the existing social education.

279
00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:29.842
I have a strong prejudice,

280
00:19:30.012 --> 00:19:32.911
and I've become intimidated with age although I pretend not to be.

281
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:35.651
You're quite vibrant for someone who got fired.

282
00:19:39.252 --> 00:19:41.352
I'm good at getting back on my feet again.

283
00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:43.762
I tend to pop back up even if someone pushes me down.

284
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:49.161
(Park Jung Woo)

285
00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:51.701
I need a writer.

286
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:54.701
I bought a publication rights for a few internet novels and web comics.

287
00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:56.131
I'd like you to develop the storyline.

288
00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:59.072
I'll pay you 3,000 dollars a month with weekends off.

289
00:19:59.272 --> 00:20:01.111
Tell me if there are any other conditions you want.

290
00:20:04.141 --> 00:20:05.512
(Park Jung Woo)

291
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:07.151
I'd like to refuse your offer.

292
00:20:10.082 --> 00:20:11.721
Why would you turn down a great offer?

293
00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:13.522
It's just too good to be true.

294
00:20:13.552 --> 00:20:15.352
I feel like you're hiring me because of my educational background.

295
00:20:15.352 --> 00:20:16.621
You're right.

296
00:20:17.161 --> 00:20:20.461
Plus, you said you're still stuck on the existing social education.

297
00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:22.161
Then it's only logical that you accept.

298
00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:25.802
While it's true that I'm stuck on the conventions,

299
00:20:26.302 --> 00:20:29.102
I was trying to say that I'm trying to free myself from it.

300
00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:31.371
You cut me off.

301
00:20:32.871 --> 00:20:34.471
I'm just going to do things my way.

302
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:37.842
We're alumnae of the same school, so I'm going to talk comfortably.

303
00:20:39.012 --> 00:20:40.151
Do you have a problem with that?

304
00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:44.082
No.

305
00:20:45.252 --> 00:20:47.352
I'll be off then.

306
00:20:48.022 --> 00:20:50.522
Okay, fine. You're welcome to come back anytime.

307
00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:52.961
I'm more interested since you're declining.

308
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.161
It makes you seem competent.

309
00:20:55.562 --> 00:20:56.961
I tend to be like that.

310
00:20:57.802 --> 00:20:59.401
I seem competent when I'm actually not.

311
00:21:00.832 --> 00:21:03.371
You should be careful not to get fooled.

312
00:21:06.002 --> 00:21:08.941
I'll be the one to decide whether I choose to get fooled or not.

313
00:21:10.881 --> 00:21:12.411
But it won't be easy to fool me.

314
00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.352
(Park Jung Woo)

315
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:19.322
You can try if you want.

316
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:42.542
Isn't the sky beautiful?

317
00:21:43.342 --> 00:21:45.542
How can the sky in Seoul be so beautiful?

318
00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:49.352
Your flowers are beautiful too.

319
00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:54.391
You're the most beautiful when you don't do anything at all.

320
00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:56.861
Are you telling me to die?

321
00:21:58.461 --> 00:21:59.961
I'll die if you want me to.

322
00:22:00.492 --> 00:22:02.262
I agreed to do as you say.

323
00:22:02.262 --> 00:22:04.762
If you're trying to torment me by saying things you don't even mean,

324
00:22:04.762 --> 00:22:05.762
you can stop.

325
00:22:07.072 --> 00:22:08.431
It doesn't work on me anymore.

326
00:22:10.502 --> 00:22:12.171
I don't want to stay here either.

327
00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:13.512
It's suffocating.

328
00:22:13.871 --> 00:22:15.711
There's nothing for me to do here.

329
00:22:22.352 --> 00:22:24.082
You can pay back the money it took for you to find me.

330
00:22:24.082 --> 00:22:25.352
I'll get you a place.

331
00:22:25.822 --> 00:22:27.221
I can't live with you.

332
00:22:28.322 --> 00:22:31.262
Let's just go back to Paris.

333
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:33.121
You can finish your studies there.

334
00:22:33.592 --> 00:22:36.762
If you graduate Le Cordon Bleu, you'll be able to get a great job.

335
00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:38.161
You're young.

336
00:22:38.332 --> 00:22:41.832
The present should be spent to build your dream and future.

337
00:22:43.131 --> 00:22:45.141
It's funny to hear you say that kind of thing.

338
00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:49.671
Do you know what your dad regrets the most?

339
00:22:50.582 --> 00:22:52.411
He regrets getting married before 30.

340
00:22:54.052 --> 00:22:57.852
I'm afraid you'll hit women like your dad did.

341
00:22:57.852 --> 00:23:01.621
- Mom. - Sons take after their dads.

342
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:03.221
Don't assume that I'll be like Dad.

343
00:23:05.421 --> 00:23:08.232
Listen to me. I'm a mom too.

344
00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:11.631
I want to do something for your better future.

345
00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:14.401
I won't do anything stupid anymore.

346
00:23:15.272 --> 00:23:16.532
People don't change.

347
00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:19.742
I saw her.

348
00:23:20.772 --> 00:23:22.111
She came to the house.

349
00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:26.082
Don't go near her.

350
00:23:27.512 --> 00:23:30.012
- Dreams... - Come true.

351
00:23:30.012 --> 00:23:31.421
- Cheers. - Cheers.

352
00:23:40.092 --> 00:23:41.532
Aren't you too cheerful?

353
00:23:41.732 --> 00:23:43.361
I thought you'd be depressed.

354
00:23:44.002 --> 00:23:46.032
I feel enthusiastic for some reason.

355
00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:47.871
I think I'm weird.

356
00:23:48.032 --> 00:23:49.732
Writer Park is the weird one.

357
00:23:50.171 --> 00:23:52.802
It's my fault for asking for a time off.

358
00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:55.371
How did you decide to take time off?

359
00:23:56.911 --> 00:23:58.312
Because I'm frustrated.

360
00:23:58.842 --> 00:23:59.842
Goodness.

361
00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:03.211
Is that the title of the drama?

362
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:04.421
No.

363
00:24:04.951 --> 00:24:06.252
"Steak" is the title.

364
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:08.522
It's a story about a guy who eats rare steak.

365
00:24:09.121 --> 00:24:12.322
Does a man who eat rare steak have a special personality?

366
00:24:12.322 --> 00:24:13.832
No, it's just preference.

367
00:24:14.592 --> 00:24:16.092
I interviewed Jung Sun.

368
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:18.002
- Jung Sun? - Yes.

369
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:19.502
How did you get in touch with him?

370
00:24:19.861 --> 00:24:20.901
Did you send a message?

371
00:24:21.732 --> 00:24:22.802
No.

372
00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:25.742
He has a cellphone now.

373
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:28.211
Are you guys going out?

374
00:24:29.512 --> 00:24:31.141
No.

375
00:24:31.711 --> 00:24:34.552
Come on. He's much younger than me.

376
00:24:35.752 --> 00:24:36.881
That's so like you.

377
00:24:37.482 --> 00:24:40.221
I love how you're so realistic.

378
00:24:41.352 --> 00:24:44.822
Even if he likes you, you shouldn't go out with him.

379
00:24:46.891 --> 00:24:47.961
Why not?

380
00:24:48.092 --> 00:24:49.232
You know.

381
00:24:49.891 --> 00:24:51.332
He's a playboy.

382
00:24:51.631 --> 00:24:53.631
He studied abroad since he was young.

383
00:24:53.732 --> 00:24:56.671
Don't you think that's prejudice? It's case by case.

384
00:24:56.671 --> 00:24:59.042
You can't ignore where you've been raised.

385
00:24:59.441 --> 00:25:02.171
He flirted with me so much at first.

386
00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:04.111
Really?

387
00:25:05.711 --> 00:25:06.742
I see.

388
00:25:09.181 --> 00:25:11.022
Give me Jung Sun's phone number.

389
00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:14.151
Okay.

390
00:25:15.322 --> 00:25:16.322
The title...

391
00:25:16.752 --> 00:25:19.721
"A Man Who Eats Rare Steak" is better than "Steak".

392
00:25:21.361 --> 00:25:22.431
I just sent it to you.

393
00:25:23.762 --> 00:25:24.762
Okay.

394
00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:52.822
Are you going to work already?

395
00:25:53.461 --> 00:25:54.661
No, I got fired.

396
00:25:58.062 --> 00:25:59.802
Don't make that face.

397
00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:02.602
I got fired for a good reason.

398
00:26:03.102 --> 00:26:05.641
Thanks to that, my life is put on emergency alert.

399
00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:06.701
So I'm off to the library.

400
00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:08.312
I'm going to prepare for a contest.

401
00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:10.842
- Which library? - My school's.

402
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:13.451
I'll study hard with the first year students.

403
00:26:14.782 --> 00:26:15.782
Hop on.

404
00:26:16.181 --> 00:26:17.252
No.

405
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:20.691
Yes!

406
00:26:21.292 --> 00:26:22.852
You said no earlier.

407
00:26:22.852 --> 00:26:25.121
I'm fickle like that.

408
00:26:47.082 --> 00:26:48.111
Thanks.

409
00:26:49.052 --> 00:26:50.082
What will you have for lunch?

410
00:26:50.082 --> 00:26:52.881
Whatever. I just need a lot of food. School cafeteria.

411
00:26:52.982 --> 00:26:54.492
I want to try cafeteria food.

412
00:26:54.492 --> 00:26:56.522
Come here for lunch then. I'll buy.

413
00:26:57.121 --> 00:26:59.121
Can you come though?

414
00:26:59.121 --> 00:27:00.832
I have a break time.

415
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:34.691
(Jung Sun)

416
00:27:43.502 --> 00:27:45.171
- Hello? - It's me, Hong Ah.

417
00:27:45.572 --> 00:27:48.542
- Hey. - You should've told me your number.

418
00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:49.941
I had to get it from Hyun Soo.

419
00:27:50.181 --> 00:27:51.941
Was I supposed to tell you?

420
00:27:52.181 --> 00:27:54.482
Don't you know the basic manners between people?

421
00:27:54.782 --> 00:27:56.752
I didn't know this was considered manners.

422
00:27:57.252 --> 00:27:58.982
You should learn.

423
00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:01.721
- Why are you angry? - Because I am.

424
00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.461
Why? I don't understand.

425
00:28:04.022 --> 00:28:06.092
I don't understand either.

426
00:28:06.461 --> 00:28:07.562
But I am angry.

427
00:28:08.792 --> 00:28:09.891
Why did you call?

428
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:12.302
Do I need a reason to call you?

429
00:28:12.401 --> 00:28:14.032
If you keep doing this, I'll get angry.

430
00:28:18.971 --> 00:28:21.641
I'm going to go to your restaurant on Friday.

431
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:23.441
Make a reservation for me.

432
00:28:23.742 --> 00:28:26.012
Don't ask me to do that. Call the restaurant.

433
00:28:26.012 --> 00:28:28.312
Why are you always so strict with me?

434
00:28:28.852 --> 00:28:30.552
Because you're my friend.

435
00:28:32.552 --> 00:28:33.621
Goodness.

436
00:28:39.891 --> 00:28:42.131
(Central Library)

437
00:28:43.802 --> 00:28:45.161
Why are you so surprised?

438
00:28:49.401 --> 00:28:50.641
(How to Become a TV Scriptwriter)

439
00:28:51.371 --> 00:28:52.671
(Yoon Ha's room)

440
00:28:57.512 --> 00:29:00.312
(It was decorated.)

441
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:01.852
Yoon Ha gets startled.

442
00:29:02.282 --> 00:29:04.181
- Why are you so surprised? - Why are you so surprised?

443
00:29:05.921 --> 00:29:07.352
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:07.352 --> 00:29:08.621
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:08.621 --> 00:29:10.492
Apologizing out of courtesy is annoying.

446
00:29:10.492 --> 00:29:12.792
Apologizing out of courtesy is annoying.

447
00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:15.832
Let's hear what you did wrong.

448
00:29:17.201 --> 00:29:18.201
Apologizing...

449
00:29:19.161 --> 00:29:21.072
out of courtesy is...

450
00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:23.072
(Keep quiet in the library!)

451
00:29:28.572 --> 00:29:29.772
I'm sorry.
